1823,,1 of 1 people (100%) found this review helpful,72850,,Posted June 2.,"An epic game made all the more epic by the fact that it is so easy to mod and so well supported by the modding community.The Elder Scrolls series has a large following and often you will hear people argue over each new TES game comparing it to the last, but for me each TES game stands on its own merits, and Skyrim is no exception. The story is pretty good and there are plenty of side quests, but what makes Skyrim so great even when not modded is its large and open nature. This is a land you can just pick a direction and with no quest in mind and just explore. You will find danger and excitement on your journey ... and loot. Lots and lots of loot.But once you start modding this game, that is when you unlock the true value that is Skyrim. Potentially thousands more hours content (for free) in a game that can be improved ten thousand different ways from graphics, textures and sounds all the way to game mechanics and user interface changes. You can make the game exactly what you need it to be, and play it for so long you may still be playing when the next game in this series comes out.... and sometimes longer than even that.",DerpyAura,http://steamcommunity.com/id/DerpyAura

No. The Stanley Parable is like a mind game that the the entire game itself puts you through, with an emphasis on choice for the player to decide on, multiple endings to discover and a number of fourth wall breaking and utterly hilarious moments that you hear from the charming narrator. The Stanley Parable makes you think what a video game as an interactive experience is and the point at which video games become an art form and a story telling medium.The game truly needs to be played by you yourself to really understand.

Not only does this game have the benefit of the nostalgia that I so deeply cherish, it also has the benefit of a kickass developer pulling the reigns. Gearbox are just good people, they took a well known and beloved classic and wanted to make another game in the series, but before they did that they decided to remaster the original games from the ground up, while preserving the original feel and design to the game.To add to that, they also just optimised the original games, leaving the memories completely intact.It also doesn't hurt that this game is just, â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing, beautiful. I just have eye â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s whenever I play, it's fantastic.(To enable Theatre mode: Press escape twice, press backspace four times, more games need this feature.)I can't recommend this game enough, if you are looking for an intense Space RTS experience that kicks you in the balls during the story and in gameplay, then this is for you.Please, for the love of all things RTS and classic, buy this game, show big companies that a faithful remaster is all what the fans are looking for, teach AAA developers to do more things like this, to not â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ on beloved franchises just for the sake of a money grab, to be good people.Buy this game, you won't regret it.",quillomanar,http://steamcommunity.com/id/quillomanar

PROS:-CS:GO has a variety of game modes that appeal to the general fan base of first person shooters (Such as Deathmatch and Arms race) but keeps its core focus on the classic 5V5 diffuse mission that every Counterstrike fan knows and loves.-The game encourages team tactics and cooperation between team mates, which can be difficult due to the occasional prat who decides to wedge the bomb inbetween the car next to T spawn and a wall. But when you DON'T have a team mate with the IQ of a drooling two year old you can effectively develop stratergies that work with your team , whether its full of strangers or some of your closest friends. Friendships are made!-The mechanics of the game push a new player through a steep learning curve with difficult recoil control or making sure they stay fairly quiet, both of these things can ruin first impressions but can easily be learnt and adapted to over time.-There is a wide variety of maps with ocasional DLC coming out every season containing new maps and weapon skin cases.CONS:-The ""Valve Anti-Cheat"" doesn't seem to be working that well Gabe, now, this may just be a personal issue seeing as the servers you auto-connect to depend on your region (The oceanic reigon for yours truly). But I constantly run in to people with obvious aim-cheats, wall-cheats etc etc which really ruins the game.-I got a ban for ""kicking too many people in previous games""...excuse me? I consider myself to be a pretty fair guy and I understand that not everyone can 4K clutch, so I only vote to kick someone if they're doing worse than a BOT would or being a giant â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, in these cases, these players were being tremendous knobs (killing team mates, throwing the bomb into unreachable places, playing rap music down their microphone etc) Therefore I the teams I was playing on came to a mutual agreement to kick the players, I just think the reason for the ban is a load of cack.-Aaah yes, Skin cases, now, I'm not really considering this a ""con"" as its not Valves fault for making me spend that much money T.T only open cases/crates if you have the money! You will regret itDespite the couple of negative things I had to say, I give counterstrike a whole heartedly 9/10, if a game can make me as angry as this one can, it means it deserves a pretty solid rating. I recomend this game to any one thinking of getting it but with a warning, this game is harder to learn than your average shooter, don't go in with the mind-set that you're going to wreck people in your first day, you won't, and thats good, its just the beggining soldier.",JugglerShang,http://steamcommunity.com/id/JugglerShang

If you're feeling down like the little fedora-wearing skrublord that you are, why not get your nooby â™¥â™¥â™¥ popped with a hard-craft, mint-condition packet of Doritos and to cool off your edgy_skillz with some mountain dew and don't forget to even add in the inaudible dubstep that just adds passion and flare to your gaming euphoria-induced experience. if you repeat all of these actions, you just might have the chance to receive a FaZe clan application, son, how does that sound and where'd you find this? you'll be the face of the MLG jubilee. skrubs and hackers alike will all be rekt by your hands, and may just in fact denote you as a cheeky Illuminati representation or possibly even a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing stupid camper. as you can see, you're definitely around the corner from a notorious OpTiC application and a B&Q. by the way, check out my mate, derrick on youtube, if he reaches 20 subs, he'll do a dank giveaway. but if you don't, I'm afraid you will be eaten by the spooky scary skeletons and brought down to the depths of an aldi's public urinal.This game has many different servers of I don't â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing know. so, be sure to check them out mate or not, I don't give a damn. But please, do not ever lie to me about this game, if you're caught hacking, lose all your weed and fedora and get a VAC ban, it's your fault, u bellend. And on a related note, be careful of hackers, not only are they noobs, but they will definitely steal your fresh swag and obey cap in the process.make sure that there are no snipars creeping behind you, so you can easily deck them in their 'eads, with your mighty 360 no handscope pimp slap, as you're followed by the blinding lense flare. the mechanics, noscopes, hardscopes and of course, the precious quickscopes are so amazing, that it'll leave you screaming, ''mum, get the camera!'' with joy, enthusiasm and adrenaline, as you easily hook em' all in their puny little gabbers. you'll be the star with inevitable saying, ''watch this lads'' followed by only the kills a COD global elite sniper could pull off. with every euphoric game that passes by, be sure to treat yourself to a quick blaze of a dank spliff, right around 4:20pm, with a small giggle, ''gg lads no re'' never leave it as ''sample text'' As it will only just make them more edgy and beg them for your dank rank as well as your steam login. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing hackers, don't talk â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ to me online, or ill ban you, my dad works for colgate toothpaste.btw did i mention this game is gr8? xDDthis was brought to you by tesco's everyday value tomato soup, with special thanks to kelloggs' cereal for the weed flakes to help me write this review. they're so gr8 m8, only 20p each xdddddlol asda tried to bribe me to not write my reviews what a packet of hob-knobs xddddd",welcometosuplexcity,http://steamcommunity.com/id/welcometosuplexcity

Sound is the great triumph of Insurgency, and it reveals its power in the muffled cracks of gunfire or in the whispered squish of boots of gravel. It isn't fluff; I can't count how many times I scored a kill because I heard an enemy making too much racket in an adjoining room. The sound design works so well in part because the dreary environments scattered across the 12 maps complement it, even if they never achieve the same level of mastery. New World has done a decent job with the Source engine, but the graphics fare better in maps depicting cramped streets of Baghdad than in more open environments featuring hills and trees.

That aside, I loved this game and the fact that choices you make earlier in the Story will affect you later with your relationships and events with certain people in your group. This is a very casual and story driven type of game. I would not buy it if you are looking for a high action, shoot 'em up type of game. This game plays slowly, you need to pay attention to the story and dialogue and at certain points be forced to make a decision that will influence the outcome of the game. This game is pretty fantastic and has kept my on the edge of my seat for the entire journey. I've sunk about 12 hours into this game and that's enough to complete it at a slow pace.

You could never tell it was an engine generally thought of as bad. It's smooth and pretty.

That's where Battleblock Theatre comes into play. If you've ever wished you could pick up your friend and chuck them into a giant laser beam that has the intensity of the sun then A) please don't try it at home, and B) buy this game before performing C, C) try this at home. An almost equally fun aspect of Battleblock Theatre is the sophisticated and mature narration which takes place. For example: 'Just run like you've got diarreah, and it's starting to come out... a little bit.' The dark and brooding story of cat overlords and the sinking of your extremely happy friendship ship has obviously left you so mentally scarred that you NEED to kill your friends (just go with it, it's as good an excuse as any).

I will find you if you don't.^ Kek, what an old report.Personally I think you shouldn't play this game, although it might get better in a few years.I bought this game as soon as it came out, I bought the founders two pack. It was fun, pretty buggy, but it was full of promise. Skip forward a few years later. The game is worse. Lets talk about starting the game. The game is slow to start. Starting a game will take just as long, and when you get into the game itself, prepare for unoptimized slowness. The game runs terribly, is riddled with bugs and the devs generally don't add any new content. If this was developed by a good indie team, or an AAA team (Oh, did i forgot to mention they fired several people who worked at Bioware, and hired some scrubs?), it would be amazing. The concept is great, I would have really looked forward to this game shining, but the devs are horrible.

15904,,No ratings yet,48700,,"Posted September 22, 2014.","Mount & Blade: Warband is a sequel to the game Mount & Blade.I've never played the first Mount & Blade, soo I don't know how much it improved.Mount & Blade: Warband is one of those games where you just play it for hours and hours without taking a single break or getting bored, since anything can change the situation you're in. From bandits taking on your small party or from high ranked enemy armies, this is all dependent on how you want to play.Maybe you want to be simply a trader just wanting to go from town to town finding the best prices on goods and selling them for a higher price in distant towns. Maybe you want to simply find character NPCs to adventure around the world defeating enemies with overwhelming number using your tactics and small but well skilled/equipped party? Maybe join an army and take on castles? OR make your own army and conquer the world?Or become a bandit, raid small villages, steal their cattle and sell the meat from them?The choice is yours, and you can change what you want to do at any time, but beware of the consequences, as people remember what you do, and might just take up revenge.Now the combat system: It can be quite difficult to get used to, but once you get used to it, you feel like you have accomplished greatness. Pretty much you control if you want to swing left, right, overhead or stab. But this depends on your weapon and if you're on a horse. Some weapons can only be used as a stab instead of a swing while on a horse.I recommend turning blocking to anything other than Automatic if you really want a challenge.In the end I just simply get immersed in this game, and while playing it with auto save, you feel every time you lose a battle, seeing all of your soldiers being killed one by one then swearing to avenge them all one day.TL;DR: Control an army, unique 3rd/1st person melee combat, a open living world.",NaigHikariYami,http://steamcommunity.com/id/NaigHikariYami

2882,,No ratings yet,427520,,Posted July 16.,"Factorio is in my opinion a masterpiece, it is an amazing game that is what games should truly be. Games like this strike fear into the hearts of large parasitic companies like Activision, EA, Ubisoft, etc that only care about profit and don't care about their players or their games. Games like this show that small groups or even individual developers can take a dream, mix it with determination and sprinkle some pride on top to create an amazing game that in many ways greatly out does triple AAA titles and even puts them to shame. Factorio at first glance may seem like another low quality indie game that is just part of the endless stream of developers attempts to cash in on trends. But as soon as you open Factorio and start playing, it becomes apparent that it's far more than that. Factorio takes your typical base building and resource managment found in most of these kind of games and puts them on steroids. It takes the idea of managment and optimisation to such lengths that it requires dedication from players to even achieve a moderatly efficent design. No matter how well you optimise your refineries, inserters, conveyor bests, etc there will always be room for improvement. It's this room for improvement and sheer freedom that makes this game such a great experience and just makes the hours fly by. If your looking for a fun experience and enjoy building complex things and like learning from your mistakes then you should defiently pick up Factorio, especially with it only costing $20 which is enormous value for money.",Illuminutter,http://steamcommunity.com/id/Illuminutter

Every play through is a blast and you will never have the same run twice as there are randomly generated rooms and floors to explore. However in some aspects the game's enjoyment is withered and incredibly frustrating within the first 10-20 hours of gameplay, and as a result you will die ALOT.One of the finest elements that refine the game is it's randomly generated level, this gives the player LOADS of replayability and intrigue in what might happen next time I play. With these randomly generated levels, the designers also placed over 20 bosses that get more and more challenging as you progress and strategies may need to be employed to bring them down. But it doesn't stop there, there are close to 100 items that you can collect which alters the game mechanics and even your characters appearance, and that's not even including DLC. With every game there are the negatives and we must discuss them, so what's wrong with this game? Well the first 10-20 hours will kick you in the â™¥â™¥â™¥. You will die many, many times and if you don't learn from these mistakes and adapt to an enemies fighting capability you will keep getting your â™¥â™¥â™¥ kicked. Also be prepared to open up a wiki because when you pickup an item for the first time, there is no telling what it will initially do. However if you can manage to have the patience to get over that first 10-20 hour hurdle, then the game will be a blast.Too long didn't read, let me summarise:                   **Positives**                                                                                                         +Randomly generated levels                                                                     +No two runs will be the same                                                                    +Tons of unique bosses items and enemies (also mini bosses)               +Comedic tone and references throughout game                    **Negatives**-Almost sadistic first 10-20 hours-No item descriptions/ blandly tells you item functions (WTF!?)-Almost unplayable without consulting the WikiThis game is undoughtably fun, don't let those negatives throw you off, this game deserves to be played. I payed $10 for this game, and Iv'e probably milked about 5 times it's value out of it. For $5 on Steam + $3 DLC (that you should only buy once you've completed the game several times) this game is a bargain and deserves your utmost attention.**9/10**",76561198045148009,http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198045148009

I never expected this game to have the storytelling prowess and emotional power it had over me. I found I couldn't stop playing until I knew how the story would end, and I walked away from the game feeling better for it. The graphics on this game are absolutely gorgeous, the attention to detail  and atmosphere staggering, and the story riveting and surprisingly easy to relate to. For anyone looking for an immersive gaming experience or interactive storytelling, I highly recommend Gone Home.",SarahTaylor,http://steamcommunity.com/id/SarahTaylor

The environment will surprise you later in game. The twist at the end if verry nicely done. It's better to see for yourself.The game is 4-6 minutes long, depends how you play it, but i am about to do a 3rd run :D I can't stop playing it.Simple tips.

What do I say?This is probably one of the best games ever made. It provides endless hours of gameplay that never ceases to change, when I first started off playing this I was a little slow at progressing, now ask anyone I play with and they say that I'm still pretty slow ;)There is always people playing and as there is in any game, the hardcore group of players dedicated to winning.With 2 huge expansions to the game it just adds to the diversity that this game already had. Adding more and more fun and challenge each way.I would, have and will again reccomend this game to all my friends and to ANYONE I MEET!It also provides a thrilling singleplayer that is preety much Multiplayer but with rationally thinking peopleI give this game a 9.5/10Only because it can be a little stressful on less powerful machines.But I've seen it play relativley well on a Lenovo iX30 Which has an i3 Intel so Thats preety good in itself",TheSnakeyJake,http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheSnakeyJake

Clearly alot of work is yet to be done and everything they add will hopefully work with the game and make it more balanced than it is at this time. But so far i've been impressed with how good the AI is, how smooth the game runs and how smooth the animations are (theres even birds that fly onto your arm time to time) plus crafting and item collecting is simple, just watch out for the tribal patrols. If u've got the $15 and you enjoy survival with a touch of horror u will enjoy this awesome alphaps. personally I haven't encounted any bad AI but I have heard some people have been having trouble with em",LeBovin,http://steamcommunity.com/id/LeBovin

Sorry but there is just to much to enjoy to recommend it. Not to mention the constant regular updates and bug fixes, really it's just terrible that these people are actually DOING stuff to improve the game. A real shame indeed.In all seriousness ARK has plenty to offer to those who don't cry when they lose dirt in Minecraft.

Zenimax online took a major dump on this title by making you share a somewhat finite space with a whole bunch of players trying to do exactly what you do is redicilous , and nikel and diming us for a game that could have been bought once now having to fork out $180 a year excluding the retail cost of the game. I am not saying dont go multiplayer (Co Op option maybe) but going MMO is really detriment to the spirit of the game (as well as going to the time of the aldmeri invasion of Cyrodil is kind of a buzzkill as Skyrims events take place after that). The game is ruined by something that no one asked for just to build a cash cow--How to fix it---Go Forward to where the empire fights back the now corrupted aldemri dominion, create dlc's that opens up the entire Tamriel, embue the feel of being the one centrepoint of heroism in the world.Skyrim I would recommend 10 out of 5 :)But hold on to your cash when going for ESO, if you are a die hard Elder Scrolls fan you will be greatly dissapointed",ch0na1171za,http://steamcommunity.com/id/ch0na1171za

Pros:+ A unique and interesting campaign+ Elaborate character customization  + Appropriatly styled graphics (suited from the tv series) + Different yet enjoyable gameplay mechanics+ Nostalgia!Cons:- Levels can vary in difficulty (their either too easy or too hard)- Online features don't function properly Inconclusion, as a huge DragonBall Z fan I personally found this game to be very enjoyable and recommend this game to fans alike. 9/10",76561198018589800,http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198018589800

I dont understand how its got so many bad reviews Ive played for 60+ hours at the time of writing this and have not experienced a single crash.. Im guessing their trying to run this game on a potato..The only flaw i have found while playing is that it only has 3 server regions. EU, NA and RU. So if you're like me and live in Australia or Oceania you will have really high ping.. Ive actually spoken to an admin about this ingame and they told me more servers are in the works. So dont believe the reviews saying its unfair or unbalanced.. this is a game where skill matters.I'm able to play this game with 200-400 ping with out spending a cent and still place top 3 in matches..Do not play this game like CoD it will get you killed quickly.. Never peak around the same corner twice.. if you think another player has spotted you FLANK THEM!! Always try to trick your enemy.. If you try to run and gun you will fail quickly.. It obviously not a triple A title with a massive budget but what they have created is honestly something special. Play it with mates and you will fall inlove with the large maps and atmosphere.

They gave us their word and then 3 years after they spit and throw this garbage at your face and tell you to eat it, hoping that you forgot their promise.I'll tell you what, if you're that type of idiot who buys Call Of Duty every year plus all the DLCs. Go ahead, get into this clusterâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. Whoever, if you have any brain cells left in your little head after being brainwashed by reading all the positive reviews, DON'T BUY THIS. Don't be a â™¥â™¥â™¥, don't accept this right up your â™¥â™¥â™¥.THIS IS A WARNING! If people accept this, it'll become acceptable like DLCs. What's next Overkill?

The wild west theme is refreshing, especially with the animation for the guns and the reloads. Atmosphere isn't the same sort of ""dry desert""theme that you might expect. One minute your in the mountains and forests and the next you're ona moving train facing down gatlling guns. Not the greatest FPS player but even on Normal difficulty the game was challenging. Story line is interesting and you get to face down a lot of the old legends. Visuals were really good.

Probably not.To save myself from repeating too much of what other reviews have said, I will simply say, too little content for too big of a price.Yes, the bullet cam is pretty, and the performance has undoubtedly increased since V2, although a maxed out game is very very taxing, often dropping below 60 frames on my 2x GTX680s in SLI..  But it seems as though Rebellion has tried to save the pretty mediocre story, the generic, ""go shoot this person"" style of gameplay and the HUGE lack of content (4 rifles, 4 subs and 3 pistols, no more than 9 levels and huge lack of multiplayer and cooperative stages) by simply tying the whole mess together with the recurring Xray bullet cam, overall giving us a game that is not fun to play given the frustrating problems (objects failling to render at distance, predetermined paths despite quite large maps).  Add this frustrating gameplay with the overall lack of content and you'll be left with very few hours of fun and most likely an unfinished story.Side notes--A $10 DLC came free if you preordered the game at a $10 discount- a nice $20 off, but still probably not worth buying.-Weapon and mission DLCs available VERY early on.. as much as I hate to admit it, even Call of Duty offers more value in their DLCs-A personal annoyance is the way the sound masking works.. if you attempt to cover the sound of your fire with, say, a malfunctioning generator, this can be done.. but if one is to fire at the most MARGINAL time after the actual sound of the generator stops, the enemies will automatically detect you, even though if this were to work in real life (even though a backfire is obviously quite different to the sound of a gunshot), would they not  fail to recognise the shot after the backfires have finished due to lack of recognition of it being a gunshot?  EI, if a gunshot can be hidden amongst a similar sound, why can the gunshot not be disguised at any time if they were to just think the gunshot is a backfire?",randyy242,http://steamcommunity.com/id/randyy242

I played, made a character, tried to make a story and such out of it since the game seems to encourage you to do that with the nemesis system and all.But again most of fun doesn't really happen until you either unlock a freeform slot with money separately or you get a gold sub for the game which you can do on different terms like monthly and yearly from memory or you can do what I did and dig in for the lifetime sub that lasts until the game inevitably shuts down.Doing this allow you to access freeform slots which are basically slots in which you can customise every aspect of your character from primary and secondary main stats, powers and skill trees, This is where most of the fun can come into it since you can make the character how you want it instead of having to follow a set skill system but unfortunate it is behind a paywall.That said though from the last time I played it, the game is pretty dead, there are people around yes but maybe 4-500 tops on good days. The end content is kind of dull as well getting your usual dailies and such though there are special 'comic' missions that are basically mini campaigns separate from the main story. Rampages are where you will probably spend most of your time when you get to max level (which is 40 btw) cause it's where you need to farm the materials for the best equipment in the game. Drop rates are pretty bad so you are going to have to grind for quite a while to get anything to drop for you and even then you need like 6 of each item (add there are about 3-4 different rampage items) in order to make a full set of armour and if you have multiple characters, be ready for the long grind.The game is also microtransactions galore from costume sets to powers to 'lockboxes' which are boxes you need to open with keys that cost 100 Zen a piece which is the premium currency for the game in order to unlock special costumes and vehicles that only come from those lockboxes, or just wait until they turn up in the auction house for a pretty penny (ie stupidity expensive cause price gouging is popular with players in the game).However all of that I did ignore cause if there is one praise I have for thise game it's the pretty robust character creation system where you can select from a ton of different options (a lot are premium parts but once unlocked they are unlocked amongst all character and future ones on your account). You can be an undead superhero, a mad scientist, an Iron Man wannabe, or if you are me, create a tiger that kicks â™¥â™¥â™¥ with martial arts or uses firearms to blow away minions.Story is pretty bland in a lot of places and some of the voice acting/lip and body animations will leave you cringing as you meet characters that are pretty clear ripoffs of superheroes like Iron Man, The Flash and organisations like S.H.I.E.L.D.Do I recommend this game? If you have the cash you are willing to input into the game for a gold sub then maybe yes but this game has a lot of things that needs fixing before it's close to anything mainstream. However if you can look past that, you can really get lost in the character creation system, creating many different heroes with varying powers from fire to poison to demonic powers to kinetic force.",altoryu,http://steamcommunity.com/id/altoryu

Despite the crappy PC port with rather difficult to learn controls and extreme framerate issues I'd experienced from this game, overall its an enjoyable quirky game with a decent story and multiple endings/routes you can achieve. I wouldn't recommend you to buy this game due to the 30 bucks price tag, however definitely test out the demo first to see if your PC is capable of running this game with a decent framerate. If you enjoy the demo version, then I highly recommend buying the full version of this game when steam sales are on.I rate this game a 6.9/10.( Í¡Â° ÍœÊ– Í¡Â°)",haoliu98,http://steamcommunity.com/id/haoliu98

With 3 unique campaigns taking controll as a Predatior, Alien or my personal favorite Marine in a thilling experience to escape, hunt or survive. All the races have different playstyles that you have to master to become one of the greats. Graphic wise the game looks pretty dated (duh) with the having out of place cutscenes looking like they were shop with a buget of like $10 but the game makes up for it in the gameplay and bits of the sound department. The multiplayer is what you would expect with a bunch of maps and game modes with the best maps being LV426 and the Meat Factory and game modes being just the classic Spieces team deathmatch and the survival mode.

However i found this amazing game and how wrong i have been! This game is like no other tower defence game ever created, you can control your defences and earn barrages (killstreaks such as:Napalm strike, Carpet bombing, Nuclear warhead, Orbital Laser, and a Hero/Super soldier ) that can annihilate the opposition! You also get to control vehicles that can dominate the match if you don't feel like controlling a turret, and earn decorations (medals) for completing objectives such as ""Shooting down 10 helicopters with an AA gun"" or ""Earn a nuclear missile barrage"". Additionally you get a variety of modes including Campaign, DLC bonus missions, Multiplayer, Co-op, Minigames, Survival and more!To conclude: If you are looking for a game which meets the following criteria: FunNew experienceGood reviews (Check out gamespot or ign if you don't believe me)Good Value (Â£10.99 or your own currency) For 2 Game campaigns plus 4 dlc packs (12 missions) completely free!Nostalgia A gift that keeps on givingThen this game is for you!      10/10 Would play again until i die - IGN",76561198157640176,http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198157640176

The importance of the way light and lighting was used in the graphics and story sets this game apart.It has well developed characters, stories within stories that aren't boring and epic, well directed cut scenes all set in a picturesque, haunting environment. A mixture of the best bits of Silent Hill, Telltale's Walking Dead, Skyrim and Resident Evil. A brilliant work of art. I think the only thing that let it down was the marketing and publicity as if it had of been promoted more, I would have got to it sooner.",76561198014841100,http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198014841100

He needed to do more helping you through the game, less explaining the obvious interpretation. Especially given the ending. It would've been more impacting if you had made the same assumptions that the narrator had made independently of him telling them to you. Because then you could've felt like you were in the narrator's shoes.I saw the trailer and thought ""oh, so I get to do some discovery about who this guy is. Sweet.""I got ""Oh, so I get to listen to someone telling me who this guy is for 90 minutes.""",76561198072103064,http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198072103064

Then you get to high school and you think to yourself, man, all these â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥in weebs. what a bunch of total losers. You leave high school. Life goes to â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ but you get netflix. You start watching anime on netflix because you've watched literally everything else on there. It dawns on you. You like it. You actually love anime. You feel the transformation. The hunger for superior Japanese content. Words you used to use as a joke, you now use in all seriousness. You start watching hentai. Even the weird tentacle stuff. You realise you've become the weaboo you always made fun of and joked about. You buy Go Go Nippon. The transformation is complete.

A must buy for FPS fans and even tactical shooter fans. 10/10One of the best FPS games I know of. Great AI, interesting story and fantastic John Woo-esque and tactical gunplay. The game has a unique combat system which I wish today's developers would take a note or two of, the game puts you up against squads of 5 soldiers which communicate with each other and co-ordinate to try to take you down, which in higher difficulties can make the game genuinely difficult because the AI are extremely intelligent. As an example of such, during my playthrough I had to resort to taking cover in a room with open windows in which my enemies could see me through, instead of charging me head first like most modern FPS games AI would do, they actually had 3 of the 5 soldiers laying down suppressing fire and trying to flush me out with grenades, while the other 2 were trying to flank me, at the end of the gun fight I was flanked and killed due to the fact that I had no idea that the enemy were flanking my position. As a result of that gun fight I laughed my â™¥â™¥â™¥ off because I hadn't been outsmarted in sooo long by AI and it was such a enjoyable experience. In my books F.E.A.R has the best AI I know of and still holds it's own even after 11 years, F.E.A.R is truly a masterpiece and I wish there were more games like it. The story of F.E.A.R is quite interesting but it is true that at times it can feel very drawn out but the visceral gun fights and atmospheric horror keeps you drawn in. It's a game that doesn't rely on jumpscares and forced perspective views to scare the player and I will admit that in my first playthrough I had some heart pumping moments which I won't spoil. All in all F.E.A.R is a great game to grab and for $9.99 USD it is a great deal, even for people that aren't fans of horror, I believe this is a game that every gamer should experience and it will forever be one of my top 5 FPS games and I also inspire to take what F.E.A.R has done right with it's combat and atmosphere and down the line create a homage of what F.E.A.R was in a game I hope to create in the far future. 10/10",KentuckyFriedSpy,http://steamcommunity.com/id/KentuckyFriedSpy

However it is CoD, they have nailed the FPS formula hence why most if not all games since CoD 4 are very similar.

Just because during the ranked matches, i prefer to stick to the maps i know well (the official ones), and replaying them can get a little bit boring. not complaining though, just a thought :)the only two things i think need fixing are the few bugs in the game. sometimes the camera is set completely away from all players- this can go on till the game ends, or just for one or two rounds. Rarely happens, but can get quite annoying when playing in ranked matches. Also, happening once or twice, my player randomly flew off the screen, causing me to die.The other thing, which is a lot less of a problem, is upon opening the game, the window is opened half on-half off my screen. Not sure if i'm the only one, but it's happened on both of my computers. overall great game, you should deffinitely have a play of this when you can!",meekaplier,http://steamcommunity.com/id/meekaplier

For example: Wolverine-Allows you to regenerate health overtime.As a LvL20 assault i recommend these augments: Wolverine,Double armor,Vampire,50% bonus credits (Since you got alot of aoe with adrenaline) Energy 2x, Jetpack booster for when you take on boss monsters you can constantly hover for a much longer duration while regenerating.",vinzolvar,http://steamcommunity.com/id/vinzolvar

9733,,1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful,346110,,Posted June 23.,"This game is incredible, fun, challenging, hilarious at times and overall a pleasure.For people thinking of buying this game:Keep in mind this game is still in alpha, there is a lot of optomization to be done, still a lot of content to come and of course a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ ton of bugs.That said you will not regret this buy.Another piece of advice to new players: Official servers are an absolute grind with multi-hours tames for some of the most basic dinos, play  on an unofficial server, I'd reccomend 5x tame and gather. (it's not too much, not too little).You have the choice of pve and pvp, offline raiding is a massive thing, if you want to pvp, prepare to wake up to find your stuff destroyed time and time again.Play in a tribe if possible, solo is hard and you cannot learn to build everything by yourself (an intended feature).Low end pc's you can still run this game, but you will likely run it between 10-25 fps on low settings. Still a beautiful game despite this.Lastly, the dev team are amazing, the community representation and response is nothing short of incredible, these guys care about their player base, they want to make the best game they can and they're constantly taking advice from the player base, whether it be tiny things that make ark that little bit better or massive changes, the devs listen and care. Quite often ideas and suggestions from the ark community have made it into the game.",TheAmazingSpot,http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheAmazingSpot

Muitas coisas sÃ£o semelhantes,inclusive a quantidade de itens. Recomendo que vocÃª tire um final de semana para jogar e que esteja livre de afazeres,pois o jogo vai te prender e vocÃª nÃ£o vai ver a hora passar. A jogabilidade Ã© boa,melhor que muitos outros jogos de RPG,inclusive pode ser comparado a jogabilidade de BF3. O jogo Ã© aberto e vocÃª pode explorar a vontade,mas o que mais da graÃ§a Ã© fazer as missÃµes,mas,nada lhe impede de sair matando todo mundo e condenar o seu Save. Possui uma vasta quantidade de formas que pode modificar o seu personagem,incluindo muitos livros que pode ler e saber mais da histÃ³ria. [E para os mais tarados,as mulheres possuem muitos decotes mostrando bastante os peitos. Existem Mods,que vocÃª pode instalar deixando as personagens nuas,mas isto Ã© fora do jogo. Dentro do jogo o mÃ¡ximo que vocÃª consegue Ã© deixar as mulheres com um sutiÃ£ e uma calcinha,jÃ¡ os homens ficam sÃ³ de fralda kkkkkkkk.]-Negativo: Se for comprar,prefira pegar o combo de todas as DLCs,pois sim darÃ¡ mais graÃ§a ao jogo,incluindo maior tempo de jogo,e te permitindo explorar todo o ambiente sem que tenha uma parede invisÃ­vel que nÃ£o te permita atravessar,isso Ã© muito chato.

47294,,No ratings yet,24200,"Last edited December 28, 2014.","Posted July 28, 2012.","Its one of my favourite all time games and favourite MMO of all time. The superhero storyline and theme is very appealing to my personal preference and the combat hack & slash system is amazing for an MMO. Its simply, yet can be sophisticated too. If you learn all the powers and fighting combos, you can put together your online fighting style and combat technique to destroy all opposing forces. A lot of people slam the game for all types of reasons but people need to understand, no game is perfect and not every aspect of the game will appeal to you. This is one of very very few games, where 99% of everything in the game, appeals to me and makes me want to delve into the game 24/7. The only downfalls to the game IMHO, is the leveling cap. Level 30 is very low in my opinion and since I have played since launch, I would have hoped that it would have been increased to level 50 at least by now. Thus adding much more content and storyline to the game. The DLCs are ok and some of it was just what I was hoping for, but are money grabbing DLCs in other peoples opinions. But when you love this game as much as I do, I dont mind it at all and will support developers till the end of this games life. Ive already maxed out and done everything possible in DCUO on the PSN network and have recently migrated over to the PC version to start again. It shows just how much I love this game and am willing to put in hundreds of dollars again into the game to support developers.The powers in the games could be further externded if possible and more tactical battles amongst PvE and PvP would be great too. Im hoping the game will be expanded over time and more content will be added to bring back veteran players and bring in more new players as well. For that to happen, the F2P system needs to be looked at again as most people have deemed the game as a P2W game. It is somewhat but minimal. Yet its still enough to throw people off the game and slowly kill the community. I would love to work aside the SOE developers to offer suggestions, test new content and help expand the DCUO game overall. From day one, I have had hopes that it would be expanded and content added on a regular basis to rival games like WOW. To me it has the potential and should have treaded carefully in doing so. But now its too late for that, but it still has time to make a 360 degrees turn around and still become one of the best MMOs out there. The metacritic score of 72/100 is very low in my opinion and should have scored much closer to 80 and even 85-90. But I believe that the level 30 cap and slow and small amount of content added over the years, had hindered its progress and made the community much smaller than it should have been. If good content and level cap raised happened earlier on, the game would would have been much more known and better ranked. Its direct rival, Marvel, has a much higher metacritic review score and it is a good game, but I still believe what DCUO offers is still is just as good, if not better. I have had ideas in my mind about DCUO and what could be added to the game to make it much better and bring back its player base and even bring in more players. I have emailed the SOE about it and gotten no reply and believe its fallen on deaf ears and/or the team has given up on DCUO or but it on thr back burner, because they believe the potential the game had, is long gone. When it first became F2P, it pulled in 100K new accounts. SOE should have used that opportunity to build upon the amazing the game they already had and add content accordingly so the new players could see how amazing DCUO really is and what theyve been missing out on. But sadly, I believe it was all done as a ploy to grab as much money as they can to base future DLC projects upon the amount of players and funds coming into their account. Thats where I think SOE went most wrong. Instead of listening to the player base and adpting to the F2P system they implemented, they went on how much money they could make and didnt take the communities opinions and suggestions seriously or at all in most cases. To finish up on my review for now, I still think DCUO is an amazing game and definitely recommend to everyone that loves MMOs, hack & slash type of games, RPGs, DC Universe and a mostly friendly community base. The game has some flaws and drawbacks but no game is perfect. But IMHO, this game comes closest to being a perfect game in my eyes. The majority of its content is very appealing to my personal preferences and keeps me very intrigued and wanting to constantly play every free moment I get. I have a ton of suggestions, ideas and concepts that could/would make the game amazing and hugely expansive without much work necessary, but whether someone from SOE reaches out or even cares enough about its own game, to do so, I will only have to wait and see. I have contacted them twice already in recent times, with no reply or acknowledgment at all that they have received my email, so I assuming their response team is either lacking in personnel or just cant be bothered. I hope DCUO will continue to expand and SOE looks to add an expansion pack as rumors were swirling when DCUO was at its peak, but since then, there has been nothing but mediocre DLC packs. Good or poor as they may be, we need more! I would love for an expansion that would raise level cap and introduce a new main storyline  to DCUO. It would be amazing to see and I could gurantee, it will bring back alot of veterans and even bring in new players to the game as they see the development team are still working on the game and actively adding more and better content. As it is right now, the latest content added, are very small and lazy-like. Not much hype or even amazment about them. Seems like a small team is only left to deal with DCUO and it is very saddening in my eyes and heart. I had wished and still do, for DCUO to be around for at least another 5 years with active excellent content being added. All the possible storylines are already there in the DC Comics and just needs to be integrated into DCUO. I dont see how hard that can be and how much amazment it would bring to true DC fans and DCUO fans. Ill give SOE a free idea/suggestion on a possible future expansion to further DCUO and its content and gameplay. Take the DCUO universe to the universe....literally....Brainiac came to us...lets now take the battle to him and his home. Giving the opportuinty to even explore the Green Lanterns galaxy, the remains of the planet Krypton....there is so much more that can be added and expanded from that alone. Enough to create an expansion that would be mind blowing and amaze the die DC fans and DCUO fans. If this were somehow to materialize, I would further support DCUO and SOE and make sure to do my part in helping spreading the word about the expansion. And if given the opportuniy, even help out with testing, suggestions or anything I can be of help with if SOE were to approach and ask me to help. I would be a great ambassador for DCUO. My love for the game, knows no bounds and I just wish for its success to be limitless and never ending. Please SOE,  heed my word and suggestions, and do whats best for us DCUO fans. I will forever be grateful and dont want to see DCUO end up a dead community where I am running around with a few people trying the game and leaving not long after because of the dead player base. Its already saddening to see the same players over and over and no new people or veterans. But Im sure an expansion and marketing and awarness project would bring DCUO back to life again to the peaks of MMO history and amazement that its destined to be. It should be rivaling WOW.

25451,,1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful,200260,"Last edited August 14, 2015.","Posted July 6, 2015.","In 2009 the world witnessed Batman: Arkham Asylum. Before Arkham Asylum was released, the gaming world was still in question about why another comic book game was going to be released, especially as they were all such a letdown. Batman is a widely known hero and making a game about him and his legacy is not easy. Well it turns out that Rocksteady knew their stuff and Arkham Asylum was hailed as the BEST comic book game of all time. How could a sequel possibly be better than Arkham Asylum? Fast forward to 2011, the highly anticipated release of Arkham City. Does it live up to the hype?To put it simply, it does. Batman: Arkham City is a perfect example of how passion and knowledge of the core content can create a terrific piece of gaming. Arkham City, has shifted setting from the moody Asylum into the gritty Arkham City. Once again, the world created by Rocksteady here is immersive, huge and looks beautiful. Arkham City is full of things to see and do from the 15 or so lengthy side missions and the 400+ Riddler objectives to complete. The side missions here are fleshed out and are extremely varied, which ultimately creates interesting stories about the various characters which the player encounters through Batmanâ€™s time within Arkham City. Completing these side objectives are given meaning through the different decisions that Batman must take/decide, which results in meaningful story and character development. The Riddler trophies this time around are more plentiful and come with tougher puzzles than before. These pesky trophies are addictive to collect and have been hidden in the least expected places. Obtaining these trophies feels rewarding and satisfying as youâ€™re one step closer to shutting down the Riddlerâ€™s operation. After collecting a certain number of these trophies, a mission to save a hostage appears on the map, and these missions are a welcome addition to the content that Rocksteady has already provided. Trophies arenâ€™t the only thing related to the Riddler however. Riddlerâ€™s Revenge combat, predator and campaign maps are back, but are given more thought and is fleshed out with much more content than Arkham Asylum. The freeflow combat is amazing as it was in Arkham Asylum. Combos, takedowns, throws, etc. are back and it feels extremely smooth. The new gadgets that are obtained through the story mode and other side content add to Batmanâ€™s arsenal found in Arkham Asylum, and can be freely used in all combat sequences, not just the Riddler Revenge maps. This signifies the amount of freedom and player choice that Rocksteady has given to the player by giving them the option to progress through the game anyway they desire. Story wise, Batman: Arkham City is well written and intricately designed. Characters evoke emotion and are introduced in meaningful ways, and the way these characters are introduced doesnâ€™t feel rushed. Story missions are also well executed by slowly increasing in difficulty through each combat and predator encounter, resembling smooth flow between missions so as not to feel repetitive. Boss fights are better than Arkham Asylum and require more thought. The story is also quite lengthy. Expect to invest at least 12 hours just to complete the games storyline.Game of the Year edition is basically the base game released in 2011 but with the inclusion of all character packs and story DLC, Harley Quinnâ€™s Revenge. Being able to play as Catwoman, Robin and Nightwing feels refreshing. It is evident that Rocksteady has put in their knowledge and passion of Batman history through these characters as they all possess different combat moves, which then requires different tactics and experimentation from the player. Rocksteady has employed a wise tactic by giving the player the choice to play as their â€œfavourite characterâ€, meaning that more hours can easily be invested into the game, as to master these new characters. Although being able to play as these characters is a nice break from playing as Batman, it would have been nice to play as these characters in the world instead of restricting them to just the challenge maps. The Harley DLC is also quite a nice inclusion as it adds to the already lengthy game time. The story isnâ€™t as deep as Arkham City, but it is an enjoyable ride getting through Harleyâ€™s goons for 3 or 4 hours.The only downside to the game are that some of the early characters introduced in the game are underused or never even seen as the story progresses. This is a shame, especially for a game of such caliber that these iconic characters would miss out on their opportunity. At least these characters could be used more in a side mission or be seen later on through an Easter egg, in which the game has many.Not addressing everything the game does well, the smooth freeflow combat, intense predator stealth sequences, well written and engaging storyline, immersive open world, plentiful side missions along with the plethora of collectibles and Easter eggs make Batman: Arkham City a long lasting and near perfect game that actually makes the player feel like the Bat. Expect to throw away at least 50 hours of your life as you experience what this awesome game has to offer.9.8/10",76561198065661382,http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198065661382

The art is beautiful and the subtle effects really emphasise the immersiveness of gameplay. The attentsion to animation also achieves the same. What made playing this game even more enjoyable was watching Double Fine Adventures, the documentry on the making of the game. Seeing the whole process of its development, the work put in by artists, programmers, producers, and others was awesome and especially enjoyable for someone such as myself wanting to enter the game industry. Please buy and watch it first before playing the majority of the game as it really increases your appreaciotion for not only this game, but the indie industry as a whole. The amount of hurdles and issues they overcame was impressive. As such, playing this game gave me an expirence unlike anything else I've played.Thank you Double Fine, Amazing game.",Hosky_,http://steamcommunity.com/id/Hosky_

The build up to finding out what happened to Serena felt perfectly paced, through all of the twists that were unfolded by the player. This truly add to the emersion of the game and I feel like it couldn't be better. Even after you find out what happened, it's paced rather well.However, while the build up to the ending was impecable, the ending, to me, felt rather rushed and just felt kind of sloppy in general. The ending has no real explanation behind it as two semingly, new characters are introduced and have very little impact on the story other than to tie up the game and force it to end.While I, personally, didn't like the ending; I'd definitely recomment it to anyone.

Adorable dwarfs who dig for gold at a very slow pace, making them more adorable. This game also have different modes from Sandbox to Endless to even Challenges to test your skills you've leant from experience. I love the Arcade mode. Arcade mode is the mode where a randomly-generated map is made and your dwarfs will dig literally mindlessly to look for gold or any other materials. But be warned, apart from Trasure Caves, there are also caves that contain enemies, water that would flood your village and lava that would burn everything in your village. Your enemy will attack your base and kill all the dwarfs they come across. Fortunately, you have guards to guard your village a.k.a. base from evil.I would definitely recommend this game to those who love cute, time-wasting, offline games with a bit of curiousity and a small touch of adventure.",kuroTENSHI_bread,http://steamcommunity.com/id/kuroTENSHI_bread

26872,,No ratings yet,202970,,"Posted April 9, 2014.","Well, it's been a while since I've played a CoD game; and World at War was the last Treyarch CoD game I played. This one however, I feel, could be the pinnacle of the series - but I'm a sucker for Near-Future (but not Tom Clancy near-future, that's too close to present for my imagination at times).At the moment, it is fairest that I stick to multiplayer, as that's what I've had the most experience with, although the campaign looks good, although it's definitely reliant on spectacle. This is only a thinking man's game if you make it that way: don't expect to have your mind opened to the Akashic realm, but instead expect your eyes to be burnt from their sockets from the action and badassery.So, back to multiplayer, where this review should stay. The format is the same as usual, no surprises here. There are some changes though to the formula and metagame aspects though that freshen things up and make it a far more inviting experience than previous iterations of the series. In-game-wise, the art direction and setting are intriguing, creating a familiar world full of strange new things. This provide stimulus to the player, so that the game isn't just 'memorise map > check corners and shoot'. When things do inevitably fall into that cycle though, when one's ""in the zone"" so to speak, the actual aiming, shooting, and panic-firing of rockets into things 5 feet away is tighter than ever.So far, if you have been abstaining from CoD games since, say, MW2 or similar, this is a good spot to jump back in if you're pining for a polished version of the same basic game, but with completely new assets, environments, and ambience.A final word though on price: I can't recommend this game at the Steam store price - sorry Activision. For people in other countries, you might be confused (if you're lucky). To explain, this game costs $89.99 on Steam at the moment in Australia. For comparison, for about $10-15 extra I could use all that money to get two brand new PS3 games. While prices are rising again for new games, with the introduction of next generation games (don't expect consumers to follow this though), $89.99 for a now last-iteration PC game is a bit of a joke, and Activision are pricing themselves out of the market, however decent I think the game is.Luckily, elsewhere, and accessible for Australian buyers, the game can be found at much more affordable prices, like the $20-30 range. So I can recommend the game, but unfortunately not with Steams current Australian price.",ceige,http://steamcommunity.com/id/ceige

Only downside is the missions are terrible. All of the stronghold takeovers are exactly the same, even the same order of doing things and the story isn't very immersive, but that gives way to mods. I usually don't install mods on games until I feel it is getting boring (Finished or almost finished it) but in just cause 2, pretty much the first thing I did after finishing 2 or 3 missions was install mods.

I got this dlc as a part of my season pass, so I didn't pay the $9.99 price tag. But if you didn't buy a season pass and are considering buying this dlc separately, I recommend you do not.There are really only two new characters with a decent amount of interaction introduced in this dlc. One I felt was developed very well, and will keep as a companion for a while. The other, was very shallow. There was barely any character development to make me feel anything for them. They could have been a no name raider and plucked at the same heartstrings during the big choice of this dlc.The robot customisation added by this dlc is quite neat. All of it balances nicely with no obvious power play options. And it's fun to have your own custom companion. But this, ultimately, is no different to any other companion. Sure, I can give them sword arms, but I could just give another companion a sword for the same effect. The interface is also slightly confusing; it is difficult to follow what change in damage/resistance a mod will cause without doing the manual check yourself. I was beginning to trust those little +++.Coming into this dlc with a lv 50 character (playing on survival) I really only felt challenged on combat at one stage in this dlc. That's not isolated to this dlc though, I feel fallout 4 has difficulty issues regardless. But this dlc does nothing to rectify this.Oh and if you're not a junk hoarder then I wish you the best of luck in your future endeavors amassing your new hoard if you want to build any decent robot mods.There are a few new weapons added in this dlc as well, with the majority being mele, then energy. These are not something a level 50+ is going to start using though. Even with full modification, they fail to pack any considerate punch.There are also some unique power armor mods added in this dlc, but they are non transferable and will only benefit energy weapons users.In the end this dlc adds some cool features to your settlement and a cool new companion, but other than that there is nothing really new that is worth the $9.99 pricetag if you're considering buying this dlc outright.",76561198067721589,http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198067721589

I completed the game, fell in love with the characters and spent ages going all across Los Santos. The SP aspect is 9/10 without a doubt. World feels alive and exactly how remember Los Angeles when I went there in 2013, especially Venice Beach! Now, onto Online. One word - cancer. Hackers fill all the lobbies and constantly kill innocent players and have every item without any effort at all. Rockstar is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing hopeless. Money bags get dropped on people (happened to me three times, each time Rockstar banning me for some reason???!!??? â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t!) Everytime I have sent in a support ticket, getting replied by a bot one second after posting. Nothing happened. I'm banned until 2035 for people dropping money on me! (Rage twelvey mode) â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ YOU ROCKSTAR! It happened to my friend too. At least I don't have to go Online to deal with â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing cancerous hackers anymore. Single player is one of the best games ever made, Online is on the other side of the spectrum. Don't go online unless you want to rage. PS, avoid the money bags like they are Ebola.

But, if you are like me, I cant recommend it as there is nothing in it that really gives you a feeling of a new adventure.",76561198102282651,http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198102282651

Mr. House... Quiero decir, Andrew Ryan. El hombre que eligiÃ³ lo imposible, eligiÃ³ Rapture. Para olvidar los males de la segunda guerra mundial y males sociales y polÃ­ticos causados por la misma, y haciendo de sus habitantes personas de hablidades fÃ­sicas y mentales mucho mÃ¡s amplias.Calificado como un shooter de primera persona, tambiÃ©n tiene un toque de aventura y  survival horror; el juego comienza con un accidente de aviÃ³n en medio del ocÃ©ano antes mencionado, y siendo los Ãºnicos sobrevivientes de Ã©ste optamos por buscar refugio y ayuda, pasamos a la entrada de lo que parecer ser un faro, pero al meternos descrubrimos una Ã©sfera (batisferas es el nombre correcto) que nos dirige hacia la ""AtlÃ¡ntida moderna"", pero ya no es lo que parece o lo que se suponÃ­a debÃ­a de ser... Donde ahora hay: ""VÃ­as de agua. LunÃ¡ticos. RebeliÃ³n y ahora puÃ±eteros fantasmas. Â¿No es genial vivir en Rapture?""Hay sÃ³lo una decisiÃ³n importante en el juego, cosechar o salvar a las pequeÃ±as. Si eres alguien puro y de corazÃ³n de oro, ya sabes quÃ© hacer. y si eres de esos diablos que quieren demasiado pode, no digamos mÃ¡s y comienza a cosechar, pero cada acciÃ³n tiene sus consecuencias, aunque ellas siempre se mantendrÃ¡n fieles, pero el final feliz y verdadero es siempre el de ayudar a los demÃ¡s.Sus pros, son la mÃºsica que sencillamente es maravillosa, la animaciÃ³n aunque sea un juego del aÃ±o 2007 es adecuada a su Ã©poca, el juego te mete tensiÃ³n por la atmÃ³sfera obscura y gracias a esto puedo probar que el argumento de que es un survival horror es cierto; el control de las armas es bueno y lo que se puede hacer con los plÃ¡smidos es fenomenal, de la misma manera puedes tener ""aliados"" como torretas, cÃ¡maras de seguridad y robots guardias que puedes hackear para lo mismo, tambiÃ©n puedes comprar municiÃ³n que es algo sumamente bueno, puesto que si no la encuentras en el cÃ¡daver de un enemigo, lo puedes comprar. y tenemos el uso de EVE que sustituirÃ­a a lo que vendrÃ­a siendo la magÃ­a. Lo malo es, el final... PodrÃ­a decir que es lo Ãºnico malo, aunque muchos se quejan de que hay crÃ©ditos despuÃ©s del final, a mÃ­ me hubiera gustado verlos, y aparte de que, aunque sea el verdadero o el malo, es un tanto corto, interesante pero corto; y muchos otros valores que no se explotan dentro del juego.Al final, Â¿quÃ© distingue a un hombre libre de un esclavo? Â¿Dinero? Â¿Poder? No. El hombre compra Bioshock, el esclavo lo rechaza.",76561198091429493,http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198091429493

57371,,1 of 1 people (100%) found this review helpful,10,,"Posted December 12, 2015.","Counter-Strike makes you work to enjoy the content, and you'll have to put many hours of play into it before enjoying the feeling of conquering it.Weapons are a huge part of the series too, with CS:GO not an exception. Each round provides a cash sum based on your previous performance, and with this you can purchase armour, projectiles and weapons. Firearms range from standard assault rifles to shotguns and sniper rifles, and you'll want to experiment with each one to see which works best.What makes Counter-Strike such a popular series - and what will no doubt make CS:GO the next big PC shooter - is the thrill of the ego chase. As you die, often continuously, the frustration is outweighed by an aspiration to do better. In a game where success is pinned on attention to detail, death often triggers an internal failure analysis that the player will mull over while waiting for a new session to load. It becomes a spiral of egging yourself on to do better - and if you become a good player, the game becomes a stage for you to parade your skills.Global Offensive builds on the CS series by going through a significant checklist presented by its community and marking off as many points as possible. Gun game as its own separate mode? Check. Competitive capabilities built in? Check. Map balancing here and there? Check, check, check.As a result, there are numerous upgrades that will adjust gameplay while also making accessibility far better. The wide range of grenades, for example, will likely make play more tactical - laying down incendiary grenades will thwart rushes, while decoys, which fake gunfire and fool radar points, are brilliant tools for messing with the minds of established players.The actual core shooting will be a huge talking point for many months to come. It has been tinkered slightly and gives weapons a noticeably floaty feel, which doesn't sit well to begin with. We eventually found ourselves enamoured by it, and the impact of hits add a real tactile distinction to play.It's what doesn't work, however, that is most notable. Regular mode has no new maps added to it, while all the new guns seem somewhat cosmetic. Global Offensive has also removed some of its middling weapons such as the MP5, essentially pushing even more players to stick with the AK and the M4. Sometimes it gives the impression that there is in fact less valuable content than in previous CS releases.If one assumed this was Counter-Strike Source with a visual mod installed, there would often be little to shake that impression.There's also now a split between casual and competitive servers - however, many players aren't yet aware of the differences, mainly because the distinction isn't made obvious enough. It becomes even more confusing if you join a community server with all hosts of mods installed on it, which have perhaps taken casual mode, turned friendly fire on and essentially made it as close to Source as possible.At times, arranging games in Competitive Mode feels like a chore. Joining a five-on-five war is simple enough, but attempt to lobby up with a group of friends and join a game, and you'll often hit a snag. Myself and a few others tried to find a competitive game with no luck, simply being told that no servers were currently available.When you finally do join, it works fine, but the wait and work required to find a game seems like a drawback. We eventually gave up and resorted to using IRC to find matches, as we would with Source.Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is not the key evolution point that we were hoping for, and the response from the community often reflects this view. On many occasions, other players used phrases such as ""same old"" to us.This is elementally Counter-Strike Source with some fine-tuning under the bonnet, and Valve appears to have acknowledged this with the reasonable RRP attached to it.And yet the core DNA of the game has not lost its appeal. This is still a glorious experience that sets a benchmark for all multiplayer shooters. Valve's objective with Global Offensive was to draw together the active communities of both the Source and trusty 1.6 edition. It clearly has a good chance.",JunglisJust-M-tlifewithmegg,http://steamcommunity.com/id/JunglisJust-M-tlifewithmegg

This creation from the unreal engine, is completley satisfying for a survival zombie game. ALTHOUGH it is not a traditional zombie survival game, its is still the funnest IF NOT THE BEST zed based game i have EVER PLAYED. THe pure comical action with the witty and slandish british comedy that riddles the game is fantastic, and the FPS mechanics are just perfect (although there are a few glitches in the system when changing weapons and such, but this is mainly due to the inferiority of the engine not that actual game, and they are quite bearable)The Visuals are decent, not fantasitic or amazing, but they will satisfy you, for the game itself makes up for that. The gore is perfect, everyshot fired feels real, and satisfying, the headshots that you will lay into the zeds are fullfilling and many. The variety of zeds are also fullfilling, with a total of 10 different types of zeds (this is not including the Patriarch which is a large overpowered macho boss that you will encounter at the end of each match), in which all are completley different from one another. In the tradition of zombie survival games, the multiplayer capabilities are just great, they are solid, perfected and polished. A total of 6 players can be in a server at a time, to which there can be one of each class (exempt one). There are seven different classes to which are all different in which all can have class specific weapons (although the support specialist and the commando seem to be quite similar).There are 5 diferent difficulties (begginer, normal, hard, suicidal, hell on earth) to which their titles suggest exactly what they are, the first two difficulties are fairly easy to take by yourself if you are a faitrly experienced player, but the rest are quite difficult EVEN FOR A FULL SERVER OF GOLD RANKED PLAYERS (also whichin each class there are six ranks (the sixth is gold)). There is definalty great replayability in this game, as to reach gold rank it will take you quite some time. Personally for me to get to a gold rank demolitionist took me around a year for playing around 4 hours an afternoon (and not every afternoon), but if you do not want to put in the hours for the reward, there are a variety of FARMING maps in the community, and ever since steam created the workshop for KF, the community has grown greatly.I give killing floor a 7/10.

25670,,No ratings yet,261640,,"Posted February 7, 2015.","To those who are reading this review, there are a few things you must note. One thing is that I almost always play with other people while playing any version of the Borderlands series, and Borderlands 2 is one of my favourate games of all time, so I will compare it to Borderlands 2 in a lot of ways.Borderlands Pre-Sequal, which will now be refered to BPS for efforts sake, has a lot of potential to be something better than what it is now. For a brief summary of the game, its basically a DLC for Borderlands 2, and probably would have been better if it was. The good things about BPS is that the new characters are amazing. I won't deny that. I absolutely love the idea of playing as claptrap, or using aimbot to destroy everything in your way as Nisha. However, the game seems watered down. I played through the game with minimal grinding, and only using guns I find off the floor from random loot drops. I, personally, played the game as both Athena and Nisha, and both didn't take much effort to get through the game. Playing with friends in BPS isn't as good as it was. In Borderlands 2, I was always at the edge of my seat trying to snipe the goliath's, or sneaking up on other enemies. But this game seems more like a casual game. With another player, there is little to no challenge at all, and feels like you have to, literally, drag youself through the game. With Nisha and Athena playing together, you can get through the game in a few hours.Overall, if you need something to play, or if you're really bored, consider buying this game. However, its way to much for what you get from the game.",Zanscape,http://steamcommunity.com/id/Zanscape

The hit detection and destruction on the robots themselves when getting shot never got old.Only gripe is some of the controls were a little clunky, oh and for some reason whenever you had a section of your team mates talking, you for some reason lost the ability to run, you could only walk. At one point they were talking and running ahead while I was left walking trying to catch up. Design oversight maybe?Anyways I would give it a 8/10. Anyone who's a fan of 3rd person action or science fiction in general should give it a crack.",jaxar,http://steamcommunity.com/id/jaxar

My parents were fighting constantly, I had no friends, and everyone I met hated me because I was fat. I needed something to prevent me from suicide. I could not find anything I really liked. I tried buying toys, but the store clerks always prevented me from buying anything because I was overweight. I tried making a vlog on YouTube about my troubles, but I was banned from youtube for supposedly impersonating Gabriel Iglesias. Google fined me all of my money until I only had $10 left.The only things I had were things necessary for my survival. I was fed a potato every other day and also given water in a shot glass. Sometimes I forced myself to use the water as a way to bath instead of drinking it. I was locked in my room every day cuz my parents were busy fighting about which console to play on. Well, not entirely.I had this netbook, one my parents got me for my birthday when I was 12. I used it for school, mostly, until now. I was also lucky enough to have a charger, and all the stuff you need to use the netbook. I decided, maybe give video games a try. No one would judge me there. I was unable to play the f2p games because A. They took too much storage and B. I would be banned whenever I joined a multiplayer game. I remembered the $10 I had left.I knew I had to find something that gave me a reason to live. I looked through the steam store. Jesus almost nothing was $9.99! I was about to give up and just end my life when I found this game. Ratz Instagib. $9.99, without 10% tax. It took up all the space on my netbook. After waiting for it to download, I opened up the game. Upon opening it up there was a well made launcher with many options. Once I opened up the actual game, I heard a sweet jazz song, and saw some badass looking ratz and a cool map. Was this what I needed to continue livingIt was. I am proud to say Ratz Instagib saved my life. The characters were deep, had personality, and I was able to connect with them. The story was unique, suspenseful, and I shed multiple tears. The graphics were revolutionary, and the soundtrack was the first good thing I had heard in awhile. It, in a way, provided everything I needed to live. The characters were my friends. The game was like a good parent. The game was easy to fap to. I could have just played the game for my entire life. It was amazing. It changed me. Here I am, sitting in my room, now infested with bullet ants and bees, starved half to death and with my throat about to dry up. But you know what? I do not care. Because I have Ratz Instagib. And I will always have Ratz Instagib. This game is my life now. I am finally happy. I am finally free. I know now the meaning of life. And only because  Lino Slahuschek games spent their time on this godly game.",Lubnut,http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lubnut

It has completely overhauled every detail of the game and it honestly does not have the same feel. IT IS SO MUCH MORE AWESOME. THe Matter Manipulator is useful now, Combat is much more challenging and fun, but most importantly... It doesn't feel like Terraria 2 anymore. This game was already unique enough as it was but now. This could honestly be released as a full game right now and I wouldn't complain, but these guys know why Minecraft and Terraria did well. I only have a few nitpicks like all ore is significantly rarer & WTF are core fragments, but I digress. If you liked Terraria, you are going to play this for ages.

Sometimes it can be a bit frustrating, but overall I found this game quite enjoyable. Controlling your hits and swings to conserve stamina and your weapons longevity is really interesting.It takes some getting used to that there's no AI director spawning random zombies (I've been spoilt by L4D) so you will get the same undead experience in co-op or solo - co-op simply makes it more fun and of course killing zombies gets a little easier. I recommend co-op for the experience, but at the same time it can be annoying if you want to level a certain character but can't get all of your co-op friends online. However there is an open mode where you can play with strangers if you're game enough to gamble.Yes the jump animations are silly beyond belief, but this is part of the charm when playing co-op. Ultimately you're in it to have fun, so when physics has a moment and sends zombies flying into walls, or fallen limbs duplicate, it may remove you from the game but it's still hilarious when it happens. It's the kind of game you can reminisce about later, guaranteed to give you funny stories.It's definitely got a lot of hours of playability with the story, side quests and various collectables. The islands areas are huge and there's certain places you can go, like the Quarantine Zone in the city, that offer tougher challenges and larger waves of infected. Once you reach the jungle, you can even find a cabin with Jason, a machete-wielding maniac wo can be a tough fight depending on your level and what weapon mods you've got equipped (but come on, we all know the shock mods are the best).I'd say if you're in two minds about this game, watch some playthroughs on YouTube or borrow a friend's copy to try before you buy. Me, I think it's fun.",mistystriker,http://steamcommunity.com/id/mistystriker

Up to 8 player maps, maxed out games can end in 15min or up to 2hours long, giving a wide variety of ways to build your forces and face your enemy head on in this large-scaled-high-tech-land/air and navel weaponary pure destructive fun, this would have to be hands down one of the best i've played, even after the game has been out for so long, people are playing it everywhere today.

30300,1 person found this review funny,2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful,355840,,"Posted April 2, 2015.","First of all disregard time played, I have been playing this game from the moment it entered the Closed Beta.Game ModesWell where to begin. At this point in time Survarium has several PvP modes available for you to play.First up is Scavenge, in this mode 2 teams of 8 players start must sniff around the map for batteries,these spawn in random but fairly predictable locations around the map, some will be out in plain sight,and some close to or within the anomaly( I will get to this later) on the map. These must be picked upand delivered to a charging station located close to your spawn and indicated on the map, while carryingyou are 100% vulnerable, unable to spring or perform any functions aside from moving, jumping and beingable to drop the battery. There are a total of 10 of them all around the map and you need to have moreon your team's side to win. Mind you while this sounds simple it is much more complicated than that,as batteries can be STOLEN by the enemy and vice versa, a common and rather sour strategy is to collecta ""safe"" amount of batteries, usually 6 or +2 of whatever the enemy has, and when the countdown reacheslow like 10 - 20 seconds depending on the map, people just rush the enemy charger and unplug all batteries.Next mode is Charging Stations, in this mode instead of locating the batteries several charging stations areplaced within the environment, these randomly but once again fairly predictably spawn a single battery whichmust be taken to your charging station, once the first battery is spawned they begin spawning subsequently roughlyonce every 30 seconds.Third and the most recently added mode is Research, I personally do not like this mode and avoid it, so go findinfo on it somewhere else.Last but not least is your traditional Team Deathmatch, no batteries, just pure old fashioned bloodshed with 150spawn tickets for each team and 15 minutes of time, whichever runs out first.FeaturesSurvarium can be played in several different ways, much like the majority of modern day shooters you have accessto a rather impressive arsenal of weapons and gear, and decent customization to both. At this stage the guns cannotbe messed with, ie silencers scopes etc, but that will be added at some point in time. The outfitting customizationhowever is most impressive, different types of clothing Feet/Legs/Chest/Hands/Face/Head/Back, of these Chest and Headcan have changeable cloth types and camo types as well up to 2 player placed decals. You can basically blend into almostanything in the game if you know how to do it right, and if not moving you can be a pain in the â™¥â™¥â™¥ to see, and locate.While most people think ""Ohhh f**king campers everywhere"" allow me to assure you that it is not the case as the guns beingso goddam lethal if you know where to shoot a sniper is rarely stationary, moving place to place as the sound alone willattract every enemy within half the map's radius. That pretty much covers the basic stuff. And then there are things likeTraps, Explosives, Anomalies and Artifacts, oh and soon Mutants. At this point in time the only trap is the Bear Trapwhich, if stepped on, will 9/10 times break your legs and cripple you, as well as take a third of your hp, oh and make youbleed too, if carefully placed, 2 or 3 traps can be triggered at the same time for an amplified effect, 2 traps will putyou into critical condition and make you vulnerable to one hits from most guns, 3 traps will kill you instantly, at lowerlevels in the game that ammount is less with 2 traps being a killer and a single one being a crippler. Combine these withSmoke Grenades (damn the effect in this game is really GOOD) and you have yourself one helluva an advantage knowing wherethe traps are. Grenades at this point is the only explosive, BUT, holy â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ is it good, you can run and hide from thembut if cooked to perfection only an activated Onyx artifact has a small chance of saving you, you will still be bleedingfrom every single body part there is and will need medical attention. The Anomalies in this game are present on mostbut not every map, Cologne Bridge for example does not have Anomalies and therefore does not have Artifacts. Anomaliesare either Gaseous, Radioactive, Toxic and Electric in nature, each one will affect you differently and at different speedsdepending on your outfitting, with some requiring only a small amount of protection to enter, you will use antitoxins90% of the time when you are interracting with one, these help you live through the anomaly without dying in seconds.Once inside one you will gradually take anomaly damage, this is indicated by the visual change on the screen, everythingwill begin to shift in colors and focus ranges as well as tube like vision effects, basically like some good ACID. Oncethis reaches a certain point you will die in a blink of an eye regardless of HP. So WHY would one seek entry in such atreacherous place? 2 reasons, one being the fact that anomalies are cleverly placed, they are usually blocking off thefastest/safest path to the enemy base or otherwise cut off access to certain locations, and then there are Artifacts.These little bad boys are a real gamechanger, there is a total of 6 different types of artifacts with different passiveand active effects to complement a variety of playstyles. From damage reducting Onyx or movement enhancing Spring tomy personal favourite the Sponge, which soaks up anomaly damage passive, and can be thrown in a form of a toxic gasgrenade. Best part of it, the passive AND active effects can all stack, both with one another and with themselves.Aside from that there your obvious med kits and bandages and items called ""Rations"", these occupy one equipment slotand are consumed at the start of the round, giving the user a solid boost to a certain factor of the game, dependingon what you ate. They are however rather costly, especially for newbies, so I suggest you stay away until you have amil silver floating around unused.SettingSurvarium is set in a world where mother nature has had enough of your â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, and decided to give us humans the boot upthe â™¥â™¥â™¥ and kicked us out of cities and homes while casually murdering the majority of human population. Once she'd hadenough people began to emerge and blah blah blah blah and you know, now we wanna kill each other because there is nothing todo and the world is a complete sausage-fest. The environment around you is overgrown and ravaged by nature, grass is up toyour nuts, some trees reach to the skies, and buildings are now just a gloom, pale and lifeless memory of what once wasour home, and when no guns are firing the sound of clarity fills the air. From distant birds to the sound of wind crossingthe halls of a School. In short, the atmosphere is nothing short of breathtaking, the sounds just bleeds into the atmospheremaking you feel like you are really there. All that, generously painted with Vostok's very own engine, designed specificallyfor this purpose.These are the biggest points of the game, everything mentioned above is the ""Good"". Now we move onto the ""Bad"".Like many other online shooters the game suffers from ping. At this point in time there are no Oceanic servers, whichmakes it painful to enjoy the game, but with proper configs I was able to achieve playable ping and could kick â™¥â™¥â™¥ atleast half the time. The game is VERY ping dependent, so if you are not close to the currently available servers I suggestto not play until there domestic servers near you, as high ping will CERTAINLY ruin your experience.Then there is a very big question of Pay To Win. Some would say that the game is completely free, other people will saythat it's P2W. I think it is neither. On one hand you have the choice to play for free, you will have access to everythingthere is in game, except for purchaseable camos/decals",TheOnlyTrueGamingGod,http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheOnlyTrueGamingGod

Spec Ops investigates what the darker side of war is, such as the underlying intergrity of orders and duty in a mission, decsions made by soldiers towards the execution of a ""success"", and the psychological toll of killing and navigating a war zone. As for the gameplay, the third person mechanics work very well and the combat is very dynamic thanks to an interactive envrionment and exceptional friendly and hostlile AI. What's unique to Spec Ops is it's rich narrative (including the dark themes explored) and the fact that it's a shooter that isn't designed to mow down waves of enemies, drive cars through helicopters and surviving skyscraper collapes...

I've had, for the most part, favourable performance with my potato machine getting ~30fps (constant - apart from clunky driving performance).All technicalities aside, the story is the strongest of the Arkham Series so far with an incredible main villian (who is not shown in any of the trailers). The gameplay, when it works, feels about the same if not a bit more fluid than the last games. The world is bigger than Arkham City and is much more interesting when coupled with the beautiful destruction effects from the Batmobile, which iteself is beautiful. The game's predominant downfall (performace aside) is it's constant reliance on the batmobile and vehicular combat. It can get pretty repetitive and would have been much more enjoyable in a smaller dose.

Although due to the small objects that are included you can't easily 'blend' with the wall. You can, however, easily use the small pieces to do nice leaps from wall to wall to accelerate you.That was only talking about the graphics and skulk though! As the aliens (or Karah) you can evolve into different types; flying, slashing, 'tank' and (the cute) support, allowing you to also evolve to the new types, each set with separate abilities.The marines look like they have it tough but in fact they do not as the marines being equip with an arsenal of ranged weapons, along with jet-packs, allow them to dodge attacks and kill something before it get to them...usually.It may seem that the game has a variation of 2 gametypes to play; fast and 'abusive' or slow and stealthy, but there is also a third variation. The commander! Without the comm (commander) you will be screwed, and without a good comm you will also be screwed, as a comm on either team are required to be able to place support structures and upgrade you. This means that if you are more of a good strategy, top down, player then you don't have to go looking for another game, honestly its like 2 games in one!There's one major floor with some of the levels though; some are too wide. This makes it nearly impossible for the Karah to win. There are some rooms where the moment the marines capture it, the karah aren't able to even enter the room, as they are to wide open. There is also glitches in the maps that stop the comm from placing connection nodes called ""cysts"", these cysts are the Karah's way of 'transferring energy', where you are meant to be able to. An annoyance is that sometimes you will get base rushed and that's the end of the game...no joke, once your base is attacked within the first 15 minutes you are placed in a permanent disadvantage. This problem is in many games, though, and can not be solved by devs. So nearly every player on this game has a mutual understanding not to EGBR (Early Game Base Rush) so it is currently quite rare to see a base rush within 15 minutes or so of a match starting.Another major problem is the difficulty curve. Due to the fact that there is practically no training, trying to understand how to play properly and learn how to 'dodge bullets' is simply not possible. The training in the game is mostly just a movement tutorial as the bots are very...unresponsive. Although there is a video tutorial which helps when trying to understand the games mechanics.In total NS2 is well balanced and if you stick with the game long enough it, will end up being incredibly fun. It only takes about 1 hour to fully understand the game... well for me it did.I almost forgot to mention the loading times take about 5-10 minutes....graphics: ++extremely smooth controls:+++multi-genre:++teams are nothing like each other:+++acceleration physics used as mechanic:++original character variety:++proper stealth mechanics:++character traits stay for only that character type:+MODDING SUPPORT:+bias maps:-map glitches:--EGBR problem:-anti EGBR community (mostly):+difficulty/learning curve: --training/practice mode:+helpful tutorial:++bad bot AI:-loading times:-scoring:22 pros8 constotal: 14 prosn=number of cons/pros totala=answer+/- depends on cons majority (-) or pros majority (+)0.16666666666666666666666666666667*n=a +/- 50.16666666666666666666666666666667*14=2.33334+5=7.3/10",seveneightnine,http://steamcommunity.com/id/seveneightnine

From the start of the game it feels a lot like Left 4 Dead but cops and robbers style. A problem (It's somewhat minor depending on how you feel about it) is the voice acting. It's laughable. Another big problem is the fact that it tries to make some sort of story but it's undetectable. And the fact that you can so easily shoot a civilian when a cop is right next to them is pretty agrivating.

It's just a table, no need to â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ yourself.Unfortunately this game has a habbit of glitching on objects and the terrain, after reading other reviews before playing I learnt that people died by jumping on barrels and such so I avoided that, but upon entering the upstairs area of the inn I slightly clipped a door frame which resulted in my character being paralyzed and ending in his untimely demise thanks to fall damage, dispite me not falling even a millimetre.After the dissapointment of my death I decided to start a new game on paranormal difficulty, and boy was I surprised. My character spawned holding the axe, the crowbar, the lantern, and flashlight and the gun and the book was also being held, I also had another pair of arms and hands, and I hadn't even picked anything up. None of the items were useable at that which resulted in a very buggy group of items on my screen, interested to see what else was broken I decided to approach the car to pick up the flashlight and the book, however my character was incapable of doing so, I approached the items and there was no interaction button even after spamming the ""e"" key, he picked nothing up. The game was also lagging immensley at this point as opposed to all the other difficulties (the lag was likely all the glitchy items). And in turn the game crashed.However the scares can be surprising so the horror aspect can still be found, however do not get this game if you dislike unfinished, frustrating, glitchy games.Update: after deciding to give this game an extra chance I played it for a couple of hours over the weekend and I was dissapointed :/ I encountered the teleportation bug that teleports me anywhere on the map randomly which was very frustrating and I was continuously dieing of fall damage when clipping an object. There are multiple glitchy textures thqat need seeing to also, what the develepers should focus on in the next update is not releasing up chapters but updating the existing chapters, I would play Chapter 2 but it doesn't detect that I own Haunted Memories so unfortunately I can't, but I've seen gameplay footage of it and there are also countless bugs and even spelling mistakes in the dialogue.Urgent Update is Needed",AgrarianSkyX,http://steamcommunity.com/id/AgrarianSkyX

17066,,No ratings yet,319910,,"Posted December 28, 2015.","TL;DR: The game is boring, and multiplayer is buggy but it looks nice.This game has some serious issues, both technical and design oriented. After playing Trine 2 with friends and loving it, we decided to try out Trine 3. I got a bad feeling as soon as I learned there was no skill system, and from there the game got worse. In the first mission, we experienced a bug where only the host could see the animation of a puzzle, making me and my other friend useless in it. (Un)fortunately, it seems that all 3 characters now can do essentially the same things, making the puzzle possible even though only one person could interact with it. The addition of a third dimension (while adding depth to gameplay in some ways) mostly just made the controls a mess.The only positive thing I can say about this game is that if you liked the Trine series for the aesthetic, you will enjoy this game as it improves upon the graphics of the previous installments. However, if you liked Trine for the mayhem and fun that came from playing with your friends, it probably isn't worth a buy.I know that I only have around an hour of this game on record, and I think that that's an important thing to note when reading this review.Maybe I judged this game too quickly, but I'm not going to waste anymore time on a buggy, mechanicly void platformer.",JohnMotherfuckingWick,http://steamcommunity.com/id/JohnMotherfuckingWick

41027,,No ratings yet,248820,,"Posted April 11, 2014.","""5 STARS! A+! 4 MORE STARS!"" is wah i wish i could say for this game. now dont get me wrong, this game is phenomenal, but there are issues.firstly the good:-the graphics:for an indie game, this game looks awesome! the enemies are varied and unique (most of the time), the particle effects are spot on, and the backdrops are beatiful. i'd put them in a frame if i had a printer.-the music: it is again, very good. a very ambient, but somewhat blood-pumping sci-fi alien (almost metroid like) soundtrack. pretty much my favourite bits would be the guitar riffs in level 1 :)-the Gameplay:solid movement and hit detection. i never over estimate a jump. little to no glitches. and a fool proof way to stop people from farming the same mobs endlessly (that difficulty meter that fills as you spend more time in a stage. GENIUS.)and did i mention mulltiplayer. because that is important. this game is worlds bette rwith multiplayer as you and your frined muck about and get killed. alot.now the bad...-graphics arent everything and in a game where the very asthectic is a simple but appealing 32 bit pixel asthetic, its hard to complain. but in later levels of the game (or just later difficulties)i would continually lose myself in the swarm of mobs and lose a chunk of my health because i couldnt see my tiny-as-an-atom charecter amongst all of these behemoths who were similarly colured, and end up accidentally jumping off a platform.-the difficulty meter/timer is, as i said earlier: genius. but it fills a little too quickly. during the early hours of the game i found myself getting crushed by mobs as they were continually getting stronger at an alarming rate, while i  was struggling to pick them off. if i may present a solution to this problem: allow the player to pick how quickly they want the difficulty meter to filleasy mode might be 8 mins to get from very easy > easy, normal can be the standard time, and hard can be 2-3 minutes between difficulties.------so despite the minor flaws with the game (and me sounding a little pretentious during this review), this game is definiteley worth your time for those who have never tried a rogue-lite game before. the multiplaayer is a great way for you to learn with a friend, and once your done learning, you'll see theres more depth, more challenge, than what you were already presented with (and you already had alot to begin with!)4/5 stars :)",76561198093360882,http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198093360882

It is a dating simulator where you have to remember important facts, buy them food, and learn their personalitys. And get sexy with them. It also has a puzzle game when you date with them. In the dates you mess with these orbs that make them gain Passion, increase your moves, or increase sediment. With the sediment you can get gifts that you buy and use in the puzzles that help you and make the puzzles easier. Each waifu has a different preference of orb. As you gain hearts for each good date, as they get harder as well. Moving on to the other part of them game, the level system. To buy items you have to gain munie from dates. With this munie you can then buy drinks, or food for each girl. Each girl has different drinking levels and each type of food they like. Along with the munie you have something called hunie. With this hunie you can level up your states that you get from completing each orb type, this also includes upgrading your luck chances.Story lineThe story line ends up with you being a male or female depending on which you choose. At a bar sitting alone, a cute girl meets you there named Kyu. She talks to you for a second and then she leaves, you go back home the next morning and wake up. She then talks to you as she reveals she is a love fairy that helps poor saps like you! You then start off your sex spree with all of the waifus of your dream, upgrading your stats. And fapping to all the lude pictures of your dream waifu.Why you should buyThis game might not be for people that are just in it for fapping. This game is ment to challenge you and not just be a free get away for you. But, if you do love puzzles this is the game for you. This game is great if you have people that are good at one game catagory. As it mixes, leveing up, puzzles, and dating simulators. This game really isnt for people that have a soft heart as you will get completely shut down from getting one broken heart, as you can decrease the ammount of score it takes away from you. But if you do get slummed out, the girls will go agro on you. My personal thoughtsI really do think that anyone should try this game. I never was good at any of the types of games that are in this game. But it has trained me more in these skills and now I can be better at these skills in other games. If you arn't going to but the game just to play it then its going to be a waist of money for you as to complete the game you need to have intercourse with all of the girls. This game can be funny at times and it will take your mind off of having to do all the puzzles in the long run. All of the girls look down on you thinking that your â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game isn't going to be on point. But thats even more of the drive to try and do good in this game.ConclusionI wasn't really even able to think I was going to like the game at first but I endned up loving it. Anyone should truley try this game!",MistaDak,http://steamcommunity.com/id/MistaDak

By not being a DLC for BL2 they are able to dump some of the mechanics that didnâ€™t work and get a fresh start without high level characters just blowing through it all.A lot of the haters talk about it being not as long at BL2 as though thatâ€™s a bad thing.  I personally felt the main campaign in BL2 was too drawn out and made you do too much running around doing menial tasks to draw the story out.  When people talk about how awesome BL2 was they are looking at Tiny Tinas or Torgues or scarlets DLCs.  Just for reference I had all classes to 72 so I went through that painful storyline a LOT.  I felt TPS kept a better flow going and the missions werenâ€™t stupid stuff meant to delay me.  Having it be its own game let it dump some of mechanics from BL2 such as Slag which caused all of the higher bosses to be balanced around its use and instead replaced it with Cryo which freezes things solid.  The campaign is about the same length or a bit longer than BL1.New weapon type in the Laser, there are a couple of different laser types, the beam type which gradually become harder to hold on target, the railguns which are sorta like a mid range sniper and laser shotguns which arenâ€™t really much different from regular shotguns.  Some of them can be useful but they arenâ€™t earth shattering.The butt slam can be a lot of fun,  I have buddies who will blast through areas just butt slamming everything that moves and giggling like little kids the whole time. As for the classes they bring a different bag of tricks than the BL2 characters.  There is no one character who is completely overpowered like there was in BL2 (Iâ€™m looking at you Salvador).There seems to be a bit more attention on characters benefiting each other than there was in BL2.  In BL2 there were only 6 skills that benefited teammates and like three times as many that a group oriented in TPS.Very good game, and I look forward to what they come out with in the future DLCs",Unl33t,http://steamcommunity.com/id/Unl33t

I've had issues from literally the main menu, involving my DPI res & mouse.

It gives off the impression that it's a basic match 3 game but NOPE it's not, it's got various mechanics that might have actually been cool. However they don't bother explaining these until you have already figured them out, with the exception of the powers they do tell you about those.   Speaking about the powers, the ones they start you off with at first seem cool with Iron Man's repulsor blast dealing like solid 63 damage but later on the enemies have so much health it begins to suck. Also the story, I can't say I payed much attention to it because it was dumb but the writing was horrible it was cheesy and boring, not even cheesy and funny just boring and and the beginning they start off with Iron Man, yeah fine whatever but then they throw in Storm, for no reason at all just because why not, lets throw in a completely unrelated character to team up with Iron Man to take down some lame â™¥â™¥â™¥ bad guys and the enemies have unoriginal names, like soldier and sniper. There is probably a pay to win aspect but I couldn't play it long enough to notice, oh wait yes I could in the first 5 minutes they tried to force me to use some healing thing to heal my hero which wasn't even badly damaged, if you don't heal your heroes they can't fight no matter how much health they have, they could be only 5 hp short and you'd just have to wait for them to heal or use up one health pack if your lazy and eventually enemies deal enough damage to prevent you from playing for a minimum if 4 minutes if you don't use the health pack, how do you get more health packs? You either play missions which you can't do because your hero is injured or you buy them. Don't waste your time with this go play Bejeweled on your phone or something instead.",rylo20340,http://steamcommunity.com/id/rylo20340

Calamity wracks the land and ravening hordes of mythical creatures are attacking hapless tax-dodging villages all over Greece. In this hour of dire need, even the Spartan King Leonidas (taking a break from kicking innocent Persians into deep holes and prancing about in a leather jockstrap and cape) has joined forces with their ancient enemies the Greeks. Perhaps the Gods are sick of yet another Greek bailout, or perhaps the Centaurs are livid at being sold Horse Meat Lasagne. Who knows. Greece needs a mighty hero (and probably better Beef inspectors). Are you up to the challenge?Published in 2006, TQ is an excellent Action RPG that has aged very well and a game I still play. To be properly playable, the expansion Immortal Throne is mandatory. As is the Titan Quest Fanpatch 1.17a, the Patchfix for Fanpatch 1.17, SSTQDefilerNET (RNG Function Fix, Slow Cast Fix) and TQ Vault (an out-of-game inventory management program to preserve your sanity). For truely mighty heroes, the following mods are recommended: 'm4ssboss3s-clean' and 'monsters-xmax'.",76561197977544920,http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197977544920

NO. For starters the devs probably know this game is crap because all they gave us for the game was 3D model in desc no gameplay. I have seen so many people request things but the devs couldn't care less. The camera is bad, infantry and sometimes vehicles just go through walls. And out of all the time i have played it just doesn't have that, FUN feel. I highly recommend you do NOT buy the game.

So If you're looking for a polished MOBA alternative you might find yourself a bit flustered with ArcheBlade's shortcomings.Pros:+Gameplay is fast and fun and can entertain you for hours+Multiple characters to choose from who, besides a few, all play differently+Graphics are nothing spectacular but pretty nonetheless+Practice mode lets you try every character before you purchase them+In-game tutorial to teach you the basics",Kyubi99,http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kyubi99

Games in Steam need a big warning across the top of the store page if they require UPlay. Why do I need two DRMs to play a game?! Anyway... lets get to it:'Poor optimisation' seems to be the catch phrase for this game on PC, and I agree completely. The first time I ran the game, I clicked on New Game and was treated to a blank screen. After a minute or so of nothingness, I had the game crash, along with UPlay and Steam, all at the same time!Some parts of the game are fun. I love the gang hideout missions (going into a gang area and knocking out their leader), and the stealth gameplay mixed with hacking is great. As I'm sure others have mentioned in reviews though, there are some occasional mishaps with hacking. Sometimes, even though you aim at the person you want to hack, the game decides to blow something up instead.The driving in the game is where most of the poor optimisation shows itself. Apart from the driving mechanics being less than desirable, it can be very hard to drive when the game is stuttering as you transition from one sector to another... or sometimes just as you drive normally. Trying to chase someone in a car is frustrating, and should probably have been removed from the game. You need to either ramthem enough to get them to stop, or hack something in their path to stop them.The story? Well, something happened, someone died, blah blah blah... revenge. It is very cliched and predictable. Nothing really new here, just left over scraps of story rejected from other games.Overall, the game looks nice enough, and there are some fun moments. If you can deal with the bugs, there might be a decent game here. I paid about $20 for it, and I feel I paid for a game that was not ready for release. If they fix the game up, I might be willing to reconsider my opinion. It's hard to like a game when you are constantly frustrated by the game stuttering. With all the bugs, I feel like I'm playing Gothic 3 again.Graphics: 7/10Story: Haven't finished it yet, but so far 4/10Bugs: 11/10",AlmightyShippo,http://steamcommunity.com/id/AlmightyShippo

Smooth graphics may however require a fairly good rig.

I could not heal dogmeat (the dog) when he was injured, even though it prompted me to use a stimpak. However when I walked inside a building and then back out again the dog was healed. Wat teh â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.-Probably not a really big problem, but when I tried to set the game to fullscreen mode on my 2560by1080 pixel screen it crashed and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed up my PC so the mouse wouldn't move around. This could however be due to the strange size of my monitor.Otherwise at this point the game is still amazing and is a must have bethesda title.*UPDATE*After more hours of gameplay the dogmeat glitch seems to have gone away and the graphical configuration glitch has gone away as well.",ThereSheBlows,http://steamcommunity.com/id/ThereSheBlows

But, the authors are clearly passionate about the development and I'm excited as to the future of this game.What I LOVE about The Forest:Although zombie games are common nowadays, this one takes the cake. The gameplay is fluid and scary. You'll be kept on your toes the whole time you play. What will happen next? Will the natives manage to track you wherever you go or will you fight them off? The best thing about this game is the AI. I can tell that the developers put most of their effort into it, and that's a good thing. Comparing this game's AI to DayZ is like comparing two different worlds. The mutants carefully creep around you, trying to catch you off guard or maybe they will see you at a distance and hide in the bushes. The world is truly alive. The seemingly luscious environment during the day becomes a nightmare of constant patrols and attacks at night, this is the most beautiful element of the game - the oncoming darkness is truly something to be feared. The way you construct buildings is innovative and original. I've never seen it done in another game before - the realism is astounding.What I didn't like about The Forest:The glitches. That's all. I do understand this is an early access game, but there are certain glitches which are acceptable and those that are not. To make matters worse, the developers have decided to update the game on a predefined interval that leaves a lot of time in the middle. In the future, I would think they will need to have a regular update for game-breaking bugs and the like but as well as this maintain the longer update time for the bigger and better updates.",76561198097166040,http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198097166040

These types of games that not only are using the MOBA style gameplay, but also using the same fashion model as in Free-To-Play. Such as the in-game virtual store consists of characters (Heroes/Champions like in DOTA, HoN or LoL) whereby people can pay real money to acquire specific characters to play with, or simply by playing the game and earning in-game currency (which takes ages) to buy them. Additionally, cosmetic skins which was widely successful in LoL and as a direct result many developers sees the potential in this and hence they try to do the same.In a nutshell, it's SMITE with a bunch of near half-naked anime-like characters and SOME male characters. I don't like it, some will, because for me MOBA isn't a genre, the gameplay has too few variety to be classed as a genre.

I just haven't been able to relieve the moments yet. If you're a person who had the original game. You're probably not going to want/buy this game considering that you've already paid for it, ages ago. The CD keys aren't redeemable on steam, it's going for US$ 20.00 it's a bad Price considering it was made in 1999. If I enhanced the game, I would of put the price as $10.00, but that's just my opinion though. but believe me it is a great game, it was hailed as one of the best strategy games of it's day. If you're gaming taste is medieval/RTS it's right down your alley way. It also does have a map editor in the game. Which is great it's better than having to close down the game and open a separate programI would probably have to rate it, 7/10 Garmes",tomeyoung,http://steamcommunity.com/id/tomeyoung

The issue is with the streaming content method via steam, I bought the Kollectors Edition which is great I was so pleased to open the box, I found a slightly scuffed game case but that wasn't a big deal because I had a nice Scorpion model, this is when I found out none of the game was even on the DVD, it was simply a barebones Steam installer.Okay so that was no worries, I downloaded what I could of the game at a friends place and got started, no worries. Then came the updates, I downloaded those on my phone internet at home (cant get adsl) and could play now all of a sudden its telling me none of my DLC isnt installed. I swear I have downloaded 20gb of content for this game and its telling me I only have 4gb. I have no idea whats going on but I'm not happy with how this game is being supported.

It envokes many of Season 1's careful step-by-step mentality and at the same time, shows a new host of characters in their struggle to survive. I guess that's what The Walking Dead is about, watching how a specific set of surcumstances pulls some people together and tears others apart, all whilst walkers are usualy ocopaning the local dark corner. The Walking Dead: Season 2 is great because of not only the story and voice acting, but the fact that you don't see some generic Clemintine throughout the game, you see the Clemintine you shaped and moulded from season 1, which makes all of the struggles much more unbareable. And that ending, no matter which of the 5 possible endings you chose, it will always be a tear-jerker. Final Words: With twists, turns and spills, The Walking Dead: Season 2 shows that Telltale's point-and-click Walking Dead spinoff is not a one hit wonder.",TheMainEventer,http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheMainEventer

The movement mechanics dont work well enough for the platforming expectations it proposes. I died more as a result of losing most of my health trying to jump across a platform while dodging thousands of enemies than from the bosses or the enemies themselves. The amount of times I've done the full triple jump thingy and either flown straight towards an enemy, gone a centimetre in the wrong direction, or spazzed out in the air whilst getting beaten on by a boss, I thought I was going to tear out my hair. It just became too frustrating.That being said, it's a decent game and I recommend getting it. It's not very expensive and worth trying.

It's easy to use once you get the hang of it after a few practices if you are really devoted to create your own videos.Although, you are going to need a powerful decent computer/laptop to run and save your work with this program considering you need at least 15 GB of space and a high graphics card. Because less powerful computers aren't going to stand a chance. The program would still work but the chances of it crashing is a lot likely to happen and loading assets takes a lot while longer. Overall, the quality and graphics are very high. Moving props and skeletons uses a similar system to Garry's Mod's Bone Manipulator but slightly more sophisticated and plus this software is produced by Valve and inturn they use it to create their videos.

Granted, we were given an infinite universe to explore, space battles, trading and upgrading, and I truly enjoyed the time I had to do all those things, but those things lose its charm almost after the first few days of playing (3-4 hours a gaming session). After the first few planets and galaxies, I was left the thought, ""Now what?"". Explore more planets? Sure why not. But after a while, each undiscovered planet I came across only had me going,"" eh, I'll check that out later"". For a game that's all about exploring planets while travelling to the center of the universe, being bored of exploration shouldn't be happening. But it does. Why? Because while all planets are supposedly unique in terms of flora and fauna, you're pretty much expecting to see the same thing. I was told that I can try to learn all the alien languages and words, but I asked myself, ""Why though? Most of the time, I can make out what they are saying despite the broken english"". ""Upgrade your ship/suit/tool to max!"" BUT WHY?! It'll only make doing the same thing (exploring the galaxy full of lifeless planets) that more convenient. I'll be seeing the same planets over and over again, just with a different colored sky.I feel that this game will have no man left to explore the skies of countless, yet lifeless, planets. I fell into the hype, and I'm paying the price ( $80 AUD ). I wanted to like this game! If anything I hate the fact that I hate this game. I wish I coule get a refund before I hit the 2 hour mark, but I was being optimistic hoping that there is something more if I just kept at it. Apparently with this game, its not about getting to the destination, but rather the journey to getting there. After playing for a while, I wanted to get to the center as fast as possible just so I can feel satisfied in spending $80 and be done with it.",76561198033432863,http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198033432863

A few weeks ago though, I found the first three on sale and decided to get them. Having more context to the characters gave it some clarity and helped me understand what was going on. I'd recommend anyone who hasn't to at least take a brief look at the characters origins.For the game proper, it's an interesting mix of open world mayhem with a lot of destruction and some crazy superpowers. Although the story starts well, the tedious and long introduction to the world gets a bit annoying, but as the game progresses the missions get even weirder and pretty funny. Fight a giant soft drink mascot with a national monument!As I said though, the context of the missions is very bizzare and often will make absolutely no sense if you haven't played or at least read up on the previous games.

When I first saw this on Greenlight, I thought this could be the perfect alternative towards Portal & QUBE (because they don't work on my current laptop) but then I heard that this game was discounted at 96%! Hearing that must of made the game sound really bad but I ignored it. I read the description of Polarity, claiming that it's the most fun Puzzle game since Portal (I even saw a comment on the greenlight page that the dev(s) don't even know what Portal was). Gameplay was just too simple & it lasted only for an hour on my side, the first time playing Portal brought so much confusion that it was thrilling, this game just wanted me to go to sleep. I also looked around the levels set up & I saw so many flaws that it looked like it was rushed from development just to gain revenue. The worst part about it is that it has no decent story, Portal's story was so fasinating that I want to find out more about its connections with Half-Life 2, Polarity states that your a hacker thats trying to access a virtual vault when these levels don't look anything like a firewall. In conclusion, If you want a better puzzle game at a cheap price, Get something that was made perfectly & looks challenging (even if it has mixed ratings). All that it can be used now is to haul trading cards & allowing a short sleep mode onto yourself.",76561198084307939,http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198084307939

Several forms of rust are distinguishable both visually and by spectroscopy, and form under different circumstances. Rust consists of hydrated iron oxides Fe2O3Â·nH2O and iron oxide-hydroxide (FeO(OH), Fe(OH)3).Given sufficient time, oxygen, and water, any iron mass will eventually convert entirely to rust and disintegrate. Surface rust is flaky and friable, and provides no protection to the underlying iron, unlike the formation of patina on copper surfaces. Rusting is the common term for corrosion of iron and its alloys, such as steel. Many other metals undergo equivalent corrosion, but the resulting oxides are not commonly called rust.Other forms of rust exist, like the result of reactions between iron and chloride in an environment deprived of oxygen â€“ rebar used in underwater concrete pillars is an example â€“ which generates green rust.",NexusAU,http://steamcommunity.com/id/NexusAU

I m leaning out of a child s bedroom, a sharp departure from the Formica wasteland of Freddy Fazbear s pizzeria, peering down a hallway swallowed in darkness. I may as well be staring into a lion s mouth. When I risk a glance out one of the two flanking doors into the dark corridors beyond, my perspective skews unnervingly. I can imagine my hands hugging the wall, an ostensible anchor against the nightmares bumping in the blackness.Nothing jumps out at me this time. The moment passes, and it's back to the same movements and mouse-clicks I ve repeated dozens of times before. I should ve yawned five minutes ago, but soon I m once more forcing my heart back down my throat for my next peek outside. This repeats for quite some minutes. If FNAF 4 needed a box blurb, it d read something like a rollercoaster of apprehension.FNAF 4 s composition is another rivet in the series steel-clad design which immortalized its Let s Play legacy in a few short months: five 8-minute nights of staying put in a room while fending off a quick death (and a nasty jumpscare) from creepy, walking animatronic animals using careful surveillance and snappily blocking access to whatever shuffles close. Loud screeches and terrifying robotic visages are common, so a strong resolve helps. Mostly.Boy meets demonAbove anything, developer Scott Cawthon s tenacity at constantly tweaking his formula for horror is almost Kubrickian in its meticulousness. FNAF 4 s fundamentals stay firmly acquaintedâ€”a familiarly symmetrical room; the reprise of Bonnie, Chica, Freddy, and Foxy as primary antagonists; the usage of doors as a primary defensive mechanicâ€”but its differences offer a refreshing new presentation of the risk-reward seesaw of its predecessors.Replacing the ever-troubled pizzeria from previous games is the nighttime bedroom of a kid who both substitutes for the hilariously underpaid security guard as the main character and clearly establishes his traumatic phobia of Freddy s friends with a constant Binding-of-Isaac-esque flow of tears. In a flagrant flouting of the status quo, the camera system is removed entirely. Checking for an impending attack involves running up to a door, leaning out, and clicking on a flashlight (thankfully with unlimited battery power) or slamming the door shut at the precise moment I anticipate something lunging for me.As before, staying alive demands familiarization with each animatronic s behavior. Where sight and constant camera tracking facilitated this in earlier games, FNAF 4 tosses that away for a different angle: sound. Audio cuesâ€”muffled footsteps, the metallic tinkling of shifting kitchen pans, a huff of breath from something Right Beside Youâ€”indicate when to use the flashlight or seal a doorway. Being proactive is essential; a single mistake invariably delivers a booming fright. I liked that avoidance of randomness in failure, as my actions and choices solely contributed to whether or not I d soon jump out of my chair.And that s really what Cawthon is best at: ensuring crystallized snapshots of stomach-dropping terror. FNAF 4 uses the sensitivity of your senses to prod out a panicked yelp every time. Does it work? Absolutely. It s absurdly rudimentary: straining to hear something barely above a whisper connects into a skull-shaking blast of sound and a horrible monster face stretched across the monitor. Of course it works.A minigame involving a plushified version of Springtrap can shave two hours off each night.But it s a bit worrisome to see an overall pivot away from what made the series so attractive in favor of a single, static mechanical loop across all five nights. The camera system, although imperfectâ€”as later nights grew more difficult, staring too long at the video screen likely meant deathâ€”greatly defined the series identity. In FNAF 2, checking vents and winding the music box were integral counterparts to the cameras. FNAF 3 piled on the sinister inevitability of tracking a stalking killer.In many ways, the Five Nights games require a certain respect for their atmospheric lore, a twisted menagerie of cloudy dates, murder mysteries, and inter-relationships nearly as spaghettified as a Metal Gear Solid cutscene. Stepping into Freddy s world, like flipping open a King novel or tuning into a Carpenter classic, is an investment in putting aside disbelief and reveling in the supernatural guesswork of the genre. That s sadly tougher to pull off in Five Nights at Freddy s 4; the humdrum repetition of the same sequence over and overâ€”door, listen, flashlight, repeatâ€”is too much of a chore to fully pull me in. It s certainly the scariest of the four, but the subtle uneasiness and self-doubt so tellingly accomplished in its older brothers is diminished.",42456,http://steamcommunity.com/id/42456

The game basically revolves around you, the Badger mother, trying to keep your kin alive. You harvest food, sneak around (There are birds that hunt you, and yes, they are frieghtening), and explore. The game sets a tone of bright and innocent in earlier levels, and becomes dark and depressing in later stages. I personally fell in love with the kin and really, REALLY, wanted them all to survive. But, this objective was diminished in one level where it seemed impossible to get through without one of the small badgers dying (leaving only a peep noise). This made me very angry as it seemed like a design choice, ruining my experiance. But maybe this is the devs teaching us something....You can't always have what you want, your heart WILL be broken and sometimes there is nothing you can do about it. Maybe im thinking about it too much. I did cry (like a little â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥) when I first finished the game and was a little disappointed about the ending (see previous points).

Within Dustforce DX is some of the most precise, well-constructed 2D platforming that you can experience. Its unique concept and fair set-up allows you to enjoy the game, no matter what your skill level. This is especially true provided the time and score system. If I were to provide a negative quirk, it would be the key system and hub which is not entirely user-friendly, and does become a bit of a hassle when transversing from stage-to-stage. Otherwise, it is a fun experience and I would recommend it for anyone who enjoys a challenging 2D platformer.",ThePinchyParable,http://steamcommunity.com/id/ThePinchyParable

Write a review.Now this game gives a Hox-tonne of fun, but will make you feel like you've lost a lot of Bain cells. There is nothing Vlad about this game but there are limited things you can do and it feels like your hands are locked with Chains but that's Dallas thing you want to happen, getting behind bars but you'll get Houstonever get locked up once you played the game too much but don't believe that a four-leaf Clover will get you out quickly out of prison and if you do, howl like a Wolf. If you like being quiet then there is this Sokol-ed ""stealth"" where you can do everything without the cops Bulldozing their way in and try to kill you. What happens when you finish a heist? Well you should get in a bath and grab some candles and light up the Wick because you just felt the heat of a Dragan.Then tomorrow, grab a Jacket and go to the Butcher and get some meat once you're done eating make sure you go to your local Dentist just in-case you were hit by an Elephant on your way to the Butcher.

It's actually overwhelming and some of them don't even fit the Payday 2 theme. There's way more than $100 worth of DLC in this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and it adds up to a butt load of updates and patches and whatnot. Do you know what updates and patches do? They add to the game. Do you know what adding to the game does? It increases file size. Look at it: this game is larger than TF2, GTA 4 and Garry's Mod. That's actually stupid as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.These guys started out as a four man team (5 if you technically include old Hox when he was in prison) who were bank robbers. Now they're a 14 man team of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing terrorists. Seriously, they're legitamit terrorists now. Out of every heister they've added, only like 2 or 3 actually have a decent backstory or real reason for being on the team: Clover, Jiro and Hoxton. Literally no one else really deserves to be on the team. John Wick? Bodhi from Point Break? Jacket from Hotline Miami? Non of those make any real sense. They tried to explain it in the John Wick trailer for him  but after that is was basically a 'â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ it' from Overkill and they just didn't try for promotional characters. Jacket looks like he's in his 20's in game but if this game takes place in the same universe as Hotline Miami he'd be in his late 40's. None of it makes any sense.The base game is amazing and if they stopped releasing payed DLC's at about the second Gage Weapon Pack (they should just release all Gage Whatever Packs as one DLC at lease) and just had the rest be free from then on, no one would've â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed and I would probably be able to recommend this game. What really bugs me is how they make a DLC for every individual thing they add. For example The Diamond Heist was added at about the same time Clover was added. The Diamond Heist was a one part map that was kind of suppose to be Shadow Raid 2 but was in the end short and easy as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. It costs $7. Clover was linked to The Diamond Heist mostly story wise if you paid attention and her individual pack cost like $5-7 at the time. Why the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ would you not release the two together in the same DLC? Buying both individually as two separate DLC's costs just over or around %50 of the actual game's cost. This goes for, as previously mentioned, the Gage Weapon Packs (or just all the weapon packs in general), The Dentists Heists (Alesso, Golden Grin and Big Bank should be together. The Diamond can get a pass here if they combined it with the Clover pack but they could just have all The Dentist jobs together as a whole AND include Clover in them and whoever else was added in the Dentist's jobs (Sokol)) and have all the collaboration heists and characters just be free updates if you want (but seriously, I have to pay $7 for a GOAT SIMULATOR HEIST). And I'm guessing if you've made it this far you want me to touch on the microtransactions? Well They're microtransactions in a $20 game that has more than $100 worth of DLC. Sure Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a $15 game with microtransactions but at least they have free updates, not DLC's and the microtransactions in the game when you really think about it kind of bring the community together and everyone, while they kind of still dislike them don't feel like they have to buy them for some stat boost.The game at it's core is great, though. It has amazing music, sounds and overall premise but I just can't recommend the game even with a %50 sale on it. Wait till it has %75 sale on itself and all the DLC before buying it, trust me.",TheOneAndOnlyVinylScratch,http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheOneAndOnlyVinylScratch

28745,,No ratings yet,239140,,"Posted March 1, 2015.","Probably one of the best titles i ever played... This game is the combination of Dead Island and Mirrors Edge but bringing only the good of each and leaving the bad parts out. For instance the combat is not boring as it used to be in Dead Island it is intense and actually require the player to combine movements of atack and defense other them just hitting the mouse button and falling back. And it is Mirrors Edge with free world and counteless oportunities for Parkour exploration. I paid the full price for this game and so far it did a pretty good job at making me impressed, every single spent cent was worth it. Now for the bad part, and this is a part that unfortunally does affect all the players. The game isn't the best with optimization ... so if you do not have a good  video card you may experience a series of small or even larger ""Lag events"".But in general, i recommend this game 100%",Donato_Dyas,http://steamcommunity.com/id/Donato_Dyas

What I found was solid enjoyable gameplay and co-op style playing that I rather enjoy.... and then I discovered it is nigh impossible to join a game. It took around 2 hours for me to  give up trying to join people via invite, custom and quick searches. The result turns this into a single player game which with some of the bigger harder enemies and turret option restrictions makes it into a no buy for me.

I seriously loved this game, spent 2,000 hours on it, and now came the greed, the microtransactions. They ruined the game (well it was ruined before, however still good enough to play), you can call those microtransactions as The Final Nail In the Coffin of PAYDAY 2 and the Crimefest 2015 as PAYDAY 2's Funeral. Don't buy this game, it is no longer a good game. Score: -âˆž/âˆž.P.S. Microtransactions are the spawn of Satan, they are awful.

The campaign is brilliant and much fun. The ""No Russian"" mission is still a great one in my opinion. Not many games dare to go where Infinity Ward did with that mission. And they managed to pass it off successfully. Showing off the sheer brutality of Makarov and his crew. Now it isn't as graphically appealing as such games like Battlefield 3, but it is great for a CoD game. This is when the graphics of CoD was at it's finest. And nowadays, not to beat around the bush, but... CoD is now the most â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ franchise in existence. I hate it. The only reason I bought MW2 was for how much fun it was and how much it brought to the table for FPS games.  It still manages to be enjoyable and so much fun. Spec-Ops is brillaint with a friend. Hours on end went into Spec-Ops splitscreen on my Xbox 360.Overall, I would only recommend this game now to people that still enjoy this game and are willing to pay this amount of money for a few hundred online players, the campaign (which nearly everyone has played before) and the Spec-Ops. 8/10",itsfilfyd,http://steamcommunity.com/id/itsfilfyd

But under that layer of jokes lies an amazing game with currently epic gameplay. I found 2 bugs so far and they aren't gamebreaking just a graphic error which can be fixed by changing the resolution down then up. The main screen is slow to repsond to your mouse which might put people off but ingame there is no delay and for a game which is amazing to play to waste an hour those bugs i would not worry about. And when i thought ""what else could they add?"" They gave me a torture chamber! I haven't even unlocked all rooms, cunning units and adorable beasts yet so theres alot of that. I do love the unit pictures that they have created, it feels like a banner but it works.Just a great game 9/10 Did i mention that they are adding in map editor?With Moar stuff?",76561197996156672,http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197996156672

You can also buy upgrades for your gateway.The game is really old so it seems really fake (logging into systems using a password cracker and copying, modifying, deleting files and deleting your logs.)Even if you do finish the game early, basicly by reaching top status and hacking into the bank accounts of people and getting rich, upgrading your hud to the best and grabbing the Uplink agent user file and putting them all in jail or saying their all dead, you can get the alternative storyline, which is, very fun.This game is really fun even though it can be hard and boring but I've enjoyed playing it.",yougotblehed,http://steamcommunity.com/id/yougotblehed

As of now I haven't played very long- but I can say I have enjoyed it.On the one hand it most definitely has some P2W elements, but the starting equipment isn't too bad and it doesnt seem like it takes too long to get up there, and this is coming from a person who fundamentally hates P2W games.The early game is pitted against you, enemies have grenades, tanks, automatic weapons, and all you have is a basic semi-auto rifle. Fortunately I discovered most people in heroes and generals aren't very good and despite the unfair advantages they have over me, I still manage to score reasonably well sometimes.I have only played as an infantry and am rank 5 or so, so dont take this review too seriously.The vehicles are solid and it's good fun to jump on a machine gun while your mate is driving a jeep into a control point. CRACK CRACK CRACK! (the sounds do need some work though.)Gameplay is kind of clunky but no where near dayz or arma2.I would recommend this game simply because it's free.

I was an early Alpha tester and I must say, the game was good. In Beta it was even better. When it was first released on Steam, I played it non-stop for 6 hours. Then I played in short bursts with friends. Then, after I hadn't been on for about 2 months, everything had changed. Apparently Jagex decided the game wasn't traffic, or at least that's what it came across as. So they tried to make it better. But they made it a despicable game. Ace of Spades is no longer worth its non sale price of $15. It's not even worth $2. I just wish Jagex would listen to the desperate people who used to play AoS to restore it to what it used to be.

6414,,No ratings yet,242860,,"Posted May 18, 2015.","Most enjoyable FPS in the last 5 years. Bolt action rifles have been a big love of mine since the old COD2, and in VERDUN they are the weapon to master if you want to succeed. If you are looking for a spray and pray, this is not it. It has enjoyable game modes and a brilliant COOP XP system. So why should you buy this game?1 - Rewarding game mode. The main game mode of Verdun is trench warfare. You have a set amount of time to try and take the enemies trench. If you kill enough of them you get bonus time to do this. If you have someone in the trench and your time runs out it goes into overtime. If you have more of your team in the trench than the enemy you start capping it, if you clear the enemy out, its yours. You then have to defend it from their counter attack, and if successful have a new trench to cap, thus changing the map you are playing on. A game is won by how many times you capture the enemies trench. I have seen many games go 0-0 as this is not easy. This produces a sense of significance when you do capture the trench. You feel like your team has actually accomplished something more than just killing all the members on the other team. The 0-0 matches are still highly enjoyable as you always come so close to capturing the enemies trench, and furthermore it is rather true to the nature of WW1 combat. 2 - Coop XP. We now live in the gaming world of FPS XP. This was great when it first came to be, but has since grown stale and rather broken, as those with more XP tend to have access to better equipment. Unlocking equipment is simple in Verdun, and you start with a bank of unlocks which you can choose to spend wherever you see fit. So you start the game able to compete fairly from the start. What is interesting is the XP you earn for your squad by working together with teammates. You have coop xp with those you play with, which levels up your squad, which unlocks minor perks, such as military uniforms from 1918, which look remarkably more badass than the 1914 ones. This provides good incentives for teamwork, but high level squads are rare and the perks small so as to not break the game at all.3 - Enjoyable Weapons. The AK47 and M16 are all fun and good. But they require little skill in a FPS compared to the bolt action rifles of old. If you want the feel of a game that actually rewards your accuracy and speed, this is it.10/10 - Best FPS in 5 years, no doubt.",stverbal,http://steamcommunity.com/id/stverbal

This review will be updated as the Beta progresses. You are an explorer of the stars, a procedurally generated universe waits before your eyes, near infinite planets, monster, weapons and experiences await you all form the comfort of your own spaceship! I gladly give it a 10/10, and its very much deserving of a spot in my favorite games of all time.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------There are a handful of races to pick from with the decision actually making some difference in that each race has their own spaceship and their own interpretation of the things you encounter dring your travels (using the analyze tool 'n')There are numerous different planet types as well as near infinite monsters and weapons thanks to the marvel that is procedural generation further increasing the desire to travel the universe in search off 'all of the things' so to speak. During your travels expect to come across friendly and unfriendly sentient races in the form of villages and dungeons. Races such as the robotic glitch, sentient robots trapped in a medievil type state, or the floran, savage plant people with a slightly backwards society. Every race can be found during your travels going about there lives, running shops, farming etc and greatly increases the immersion within the game itself. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------Some notes on the state of the beta as of 11/03/2014At the moment the content is a little on the lacking side (compared to the scope mapped out on the roadmap, available on the starbound website) but the devs have shown since release there dedication not just adding there own ideas to the game, but also incorporating popular mods being produced by the massive and ever growing community already present. The progression of the game at the moment is a placeholder waiting to be properly implemented until a later stage of beta, once all the systems are incorperated. Currently players progress by tiers of ore but eventually this will be replaced with three branching paths allowing for three compeltely unique playstyles. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------Thanks for reading :)!-JohnnyTAA",JohnnyTAA,http://steamcommunity.com/id/JohnnyTAA

I completed it without tutorials in less than three hours, and I lack the common sense to solve most puzzles without heavy pondering.Here's an actual review for you:In this game, you are A.R.I.D., an AI helping an unconcious piot to safety by controlling his mechanical suit. All this game really boils down to is a point-and-click adventure game with some short combat sequences, from a side-scrolling perspective. The atmosphere is well-made, but I feel a majority of the puzzles are a bit too open-ended (for one, you have to jump underneath a ten-foot-wide elevator where the only control panel for it is on the elevator itself).Again, it's not worth it in its current state.

WE NEED MORE GOD DAMN CONTENT!! I feel the creator should really add in some new endings and lines for the narrator, but most of all, WALKTHROUGHS!!! I WANT THE DAMN WHITEBOARD ENDING!!!Anyways in the game you will be given a choice. Go with the crowd or go solo and make your own story. I really recommend to go against the system but still, do what you want to do. The game will allow it. The narrator may be sad but who cares, its just a game. The game also has lots of twist and hilariousness. I'm not going to spoil it because its such an awesome game but stanley should get is PAYDAY.

Overall a enjoyable map which is good for new players to learn how to train and sustain points with interesting art.Five 6/10----------This map is extremely hard. Due to there only being one training spot in this map which is expensive to get to and to make it work well you need to buy 2 doors or so. The boss is also painful to deal with as he can take away your gun but if you kill it you receive a Bonfire sale. The Winter's Howl is a bad Wonderweapon which effects the map. Overall the map is good with friends due to a fun camping spot in the elevators but solo it is hard to get to high rounds due to there only being one training spot.Ascension 8/10----------------This map is pretty sick. With the first kind of new way to receive pack a punch launching the three flight pads. The map was pretty easy due to the fact that you could train anywhere pretty well and having the Thunder gun, though it had hard elements of it such as the monkeys forcing you if playing solo to only really having 2 perks or so cause they would just steal them. Overall a great map to get extremely high rounds and enjoyable with friends.Call of the dead 7/10----------------------Ok call of the dead is very different to all maps. It starts off having fog which is a pain and dealing with the boss of the map George. This fellow gets in your way and if you attack him or are attacked by him he gains enrage and runs super fast and attacks you but calm-able by taking him to the water. The Wonderweapons are great the Scavenger is a great explosive weapon but PHD is needed or becomes useless and will kill you. The VR-11 Is good to take out George but making him calm and turns a zombie into a human like a moving monkey bomb. The map is good with a decent training spot and enjoyable oh though has annoying features like George and how far jug and the power is from spawn. Overall a good map and worth playing.Shangri-La 4/10-----------------Ok ok this map is a very hard and badly made map. Due to it being so close quartered there is no real good training spots but the fact you have the Baby maker does make it some how survival-able cause its a great weapon. The map itself looks amazing with cool looking textures and a amazing atmosphere with it being all tropical. Overall the fact the map brought cool new stuff like the water and new zombies it makes it enjoyable but it is unlikely to get to a high round on.Moon 3.5/10--------------Moon is one of those maps you really enjoy or dislike. For me its dislike I love the theme of the moon but the fact low gravity really does mess with you as you can bounce back into your train is annoying as hell. This map has a sick Easter egg blowing up the earth and empowering the Aether to Richthofen. The map has a nice feel to it but is annoying spawning on earth then going to the moon and how you have to do this 2 times to get jug unless your a skilled player. A map for people that are better at zombies but still pretty bad due to it being annoying hard to get basics.In the end buying black ops one is a good idea but do buy with all the maps. Its much harder then black ops 2 due to maps just being made worse and harder mainly cause training in most of these maps can be quite a challenge. Overall the game is 36/60 which is worth a buy.",Lunaii,http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lunaii

Paid 20c and this game is really enjoyable. It's probably not the game to lose heaps of hours in, I'm sure I'll do at least 2 full play-throughs at about 4 hours total, but there is no real replay value apart from the fact the game itself is really fun. There is no story, no real variety in enemies, and no people to talk to (apart from at the beginning and end of each level for a very quick debriefing, which is still only text). But at a price like this, I can't argue. Even at the full $3 price it's well worth it. If you miss your old nintendo 64, gamecube and PS2 games then this is one for you. It certainly feels like a worthwhile indie gem for all to enjoy.",itsfilfyd,http://steamcommunity.com/id/itsfilfyd

45693,,No ratings yet,377160,"Last edited November 14, 2015.","Posted November 14, 2015.","For me the fun in playing Fallout 4 has been about the brief moments in between all the other stuff, sure a lot of the game is going to one location or other and killing loads of the same enemies over and over, then fetching misc_item01 and returning it to the quest giver, but the typically rather bland combat and quests are punctuated by incredible moments of joy, wonder and exploration. I still haven't finished the main quest, but it's already engaged me in a way that no other Bethesda game hasUnfortunately Fallout 4 still has a lot of the issues other Bethesda titles have suffered from like bugginess, random crashes, frame rate drops, insufficient tutorialisation, and moments of bad writing and/or voice acting. The good news is that all the stuff Bethesda are great at like character customisation and progression, world building, and of course the construction of hundreds if not thousands of mininarratives across the world have all been done exceptionally well here.The settlement system is fun but could certainly have used more attention. There's very little explanation of how it works and some obvious and painful limitations to it (which of course make me all the more eager for the creation kit's release). The stringent no-clipping rules are a pain, as is being unable to turn off automatic snapping, and time and again I find myself wanting to build objects which exist everywhere in the wasteland but can't be built in settlements (campfires for instance).Bethesda needs to improve in not releasing broken unpolished games, but in playing it I've found it hard to point out situations where cutting a feature, location, quest, etc and spending the equivalent resources on bugtesting would result in a better game.Edit: Probably should have mentioned, I'm not a fan of the dialogue system's ""press right to be an â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, press down to be that kid in class who sucked up to the teacher, press left for wildcard? usually a sarcastic â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ though."" Not only does it suffer from the classic Mass Effect problem of not really knowing what your character is actually going to say, but it's taken out room for SPECIAL checks other than the charisma one. Getting access to different dialogue options based on your strength, intelligence, etc. were one of my favourite things of FO3 and NV.",76561198013565069,http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198013565069

One of them is a hyperion worker whos on the way to earn a promotion his name is Rhys - the other one is a Con-Artist who is selling a fake vault key for ten million dollars and her name is Fiona. So far only two episodes have come out but it is all worth the twenty-five dollars because this game includes action, great story, awesome mechanics, good graphics, and alot more to offer. Episode one focuses on our two heros (kinda) while episode two starts to open up more action and backstory although episode one has some action in it episode two brings the fire (literally).

Guided by an omnipresent voice, you make your way through the different chambers of increasingly difficult tests.Although this synopsis may make this game seem somewhat shallow, it most certainly is not. The main character, Chell, although mute, develops a personality regardless. An attachment is created with this voice guiding you. And, most cryptically, is the hidden areas in the chambers. These give background into Aperture Laboratories, the 'voice', and possibly the sole survivor.When compared to Portal 2, Portal does have some significant flaws. This include a lack of characters and personality which, although there, isn't built upon until later in the game. There aren't as many testing mechanics in the original, but this leads to much more creative test designes, requiring ingenuity over resources.Overall, this game is amazing, and you will fell dissapointed upon its completion. Portal 2 builds upon the first, and is a must after this is completed.",dragonlore23,http://steamcommunity.com/id/dragonlore23

There is no storyline, just the three levels and you're done. There's nothing to reward your completion of them, not so much as an acknowledgment, you just appear back at the main menu.Obviously the game is NOT about gameplay, however I will review it anyway because it broke my immersion a bit as the kid , who requires a bit of finesse for his level, is near impossible to control easily. Overall, the game conveys it's message without any frills or really doing anything more. I feel like the concept was good, if a little cliche, but it could have had a much larger impact with a bit more of a cinematic experience. give the player some emotions.Definitely get it if you're interested, it was a 2 minute download and a 5 minute game, but don't expect it to be a revelation.",PENGAmurungu,http://steamcommunity.com/id/PENGAmurungu

21539,,No ratings yet,210770,,"Posted January 1, 2015.","Sanctum 2 is one really the only FPS/Tower Defence Game.  No game has dones something like this before and had the risk of majorly failing.  Coffee Stains studios did extremely well in their game.  They've put so much detail into every map and enemy.  Coming from their first Sanctum, they really kept it up.  Even though there are big changes, it will still feel like the first one.  Both games rely heavily on your strategies.  There are multiple ways to beat the level but there are always those setups that beat every other.  I have to say, Co-op is where this really gets the fame and attention it has.  Playing a normal Tower Defence, you are by yourself, just watching things happen.  Sanctum solo makes you feel pretty awesome as you are taking down waves after waves.  But when the co-op starts, things get much better.  You and your friends will be jumping all over the map blasting enemies to pieces and having a great time.  I have played a lot more solo than I have co-op but I definetely like Co-op more.  You get more people to with resources to build your towers, two extra guns and 3 perks to switch with.  The choice of perks and weapons and towers are very important.  You don't want to take an Anti-Air tower into a map with no flying units (that's a wasted tower), and you don't want a perk that gives you speed increase if it's a map where you don't even need to run and you can stay still the whole time.  There are perks and weapons for almost every kind of play style, from cover sniper, to rocket launcher madman and your classic assault.  Downsides: Difficulty is random as the story continues.  And I don't mean if you do well on one level it suddenly gets hard.  I mean that you can be going through easy levels, then the next 2 are extremely hard and it gives no warning, suddenly gets hard then drops back down.  It will cause frustration but there is a restart button if you get stuck.  Lag:  I know this isn't the game's fault but if you are playing with someone and one of you has lag or gets a random lag spike, it really downs the game and makes it impossible to play properly.  If lag is an issue for you, stay away from Co-opTroll weapons:  I'm serious, there are some weapons in the game that look like they have been made for trolling other players.  They have serious knockback and will p*ss people off a lot.  It sends the person being shot flying and knocking them off the map in the middle of a big fight.  This is one of my favourite games because it's just works brilliantly in so many ways.  There are more things I should talk about such as how great the game looks and the little minigames featured, but I won't.  That's for you to experience.",vertwheeler9,http://steamcommunity.com/id/vertwheeler9

I started off with its third instalment and that got me hooked. This game improves upon an already good formula with its superior graphics, campaign and detail. For those of you who are unfamiliar with the series, think Caribbean city-builder. One of the most appealing things about this game is just its all-round humour. While being a tad childish, you can still get a laugh out of some of the jokes - especially the stereotypes. The game's awesome latin soundtrack is also pretty good too. It's a very self-aware game and that's why I love it. If you've never played a game in the series before, this is where you should start.",plasmakat,http://steamcommunity.com/id/plasmakat

It is a third-person shooter that combines the addictiveness of levelling  and upgrading your gear in MMOs with pretty open parkour capabilities and a set of exoskeleton suits which all vary in playstyle and appearance. As you would expect in an free-to-play game, you can buy a lot of the stuff, if you want, but to be honest, everything that the game has to offer can be obtained by actually playing the game and items earned that way always feel the best. Such as slowing acquiring the components for a Warframe by constructing them and then combining them and in just 3 days you have yourself a shiny new Warframe, always exciting if I do say so myself. It can also be great fun if you play with friends as anyone can join anyone's game so an experienced player can carry a new player to the ends of the galaxy (literally in this game) and it is always fun flipping all over the places and doing slide kills (even though it may be a little impractical).",hoarfrostkid,http://steamcommunity.com/id/hoarfrostkid

2788,,No ratings yet,24960,,"Posted April 13, 2015.","Bad Company 2 is a more than acceptable instalment in the acclaimed Battlefield series. The game features a solid, enjoyable campaign that visits varied locations and harnesses an abundant range of weapons which raise the quality of what could otherwise be a stereotypical, conventional and ultimately dull set of missions. Movements and gunplay is fairly smooth and rarely descends into frustrating territory. Locations pop with colour and life, and there's a bona-fide sense of realism present throughout the environment, even when the mission you are completing is anything but. The real highlight and the most popular aspect of Bad Company 2 is the immensely popular multi-player mode. With it's vast maps, unique and diverse arsenal of weapons and great team mechanics, Bad Company 2's multi-player triumphs over its counterpart and frequently compared franchise Call of Duty in many respects. Teams feel more close-knit and dependant on each other than most other multi-player games and locations feel more expansive too. Moments of tension and anticipation, speculating what your opponents will attempt next are nail bitingly pleasant. Making tactical decisions and planning your movements requires more brain-power and strategizing than what may be expected, but when your plan achieves success, the feeling of jubilation is unmatched. It really is a game mode most enjoyed with friends who enjoy planning out their moves and attempting to execute them with precision. And with an addictive levelling up system, you'll find it hard to pull yourself away.Bad Company 2 is a great game and is a genuine classic in the shooter genre. With it's gradually decreasing popularity thanks to the newer instalments in the Battlefield franchise, it's a smart idea to purchase this while the game's community is still thriving. 8.5/10(Written a while ago)",76561198065934504,http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198065934504

It is well made and works on semi-decent GPU's quite well too(I use Ati Mobility Radeon 5600 and it doesn't hurt that much the beauty of the game on normal settings)Gameplay:It is quite fun from the beggining - pure Lara experience....shooting,jumping,getting beat up...etc. I do hate a bit the QTE moments,but you can live with those.Audio:Amazing as always. Square Enix/Eidos are always great on the sounds/background music in their AAA titles,so no suprise hereOverall: 9/10p.s. For me personally - This is a GOTY title.",spinefarm,http://steamcommunity.com/id/spinefarm

There are also a lot of twists in the story.The inclusion of 3 protagonists was also done very good with each of their respective Special Abilities. Cheat codes are fun too!Online: I played about 99% of my time in Online. The community as I expected is SOS or shoot-on-sight kind of players so you don't really have a room for making friends. The real fun comes when you are playing with your friends. The jobs are actually good and make a really stable source of money.Beware though,vehicles are very pricey and it will be a while until you bought your first legitimate vehicle.  It will still be longer before you bought your first apartment too! Although they are very expensive, they give you a safe haven from the rampaging players that shoot you down with no remorse. They also give your owned cars a safe place where other players can't blow them up and you have to call the Insurance company to get it back. The most expensive ones looks something that only Iron Man can buy,hell, the Garage already looks like a house.HEISTS:  my favourite part of Online. They are cooperative missions that need good teamplay and effective communications. The succeeding heists after the first one are extremely hard without teamwork but it really feels good once you bring home the bacon. It gives you a darn lot of money especially if you are heist leader (I got 200k once). The problem is that most of the players who joins your heists are 1). Noobs who cant do â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. 2.) People who don't know what to do. 3.) people who Perform their roles poorly and 4.)just incompetent â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s who sit around â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ while you and possibly others are getting â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ by the police. However, when someone you know or trust gets together on one crew, you can have actually fun and it doesn't even feel that you are competing. You also burn through heists quickly and you level up fast. Optimization: Hell, this console port doesn't even feel like it! Truly the PC Master Race has prevailed. The graphics looks very beautiful. The streets and cities are very lively. The effects are truly stunning. All this runs on my decent laptop with the following specifications:GTX 860M(Single)Intel Core i7-4710HQ 2.5Ghz-3.416 GB RAM.It runs around 40-60 FPS on Very High settings with no AA and on 1920x1080!There is a little stuttering and screen tearing but it isn't really noticeable and it is just probably my eyes getting damaged from playing GTA V constitently.Well, that's all I could say for this review.

It's a rougelike adventure where you are at the helm of a ship that is carrying information vital to the survival of the remaining Federation fleet; the last remaining hope for the federation after their crushing defeat from the Rebels. You will have your ups and downs, sometimes escaping death by less than a second, just to have all your success of escaping near death crush down on you when the next ship you encounter happens to be a Mantis war vessel armed to the teeth. You may lose and you may find the game to be a bit harsh at times, but it can be assured that you will always come back and try to save the Federation from the verge of defeat with what little is at your disposal, time and time again. 9/10",yungwarez,http://steamcommunity.com/id/yungwarez

Once you have looked past the graphics you get a great game with so much structure. Choose either the Axis or the Allies and from there you have a wide range of classes for different weapon types. This game is so well structured because of its community. If someone sees someone in an assult class then they will go long ranged to co-operate with the assult class instead of your average, load-out based FPS where people choose weapons because they like them. I highly reccomended Day of Defeat for these reasons and if you are still tossing and turning, wait until it is on sale when it goes down to $2.50.",legendofretro,http://steamcommunity.com/id/legendofretro

IT WOULD BE THIS EASY ... to get a 75% off Platinum Discount voucher as a log-in reward?Warframe has evolved ever since its early beta days. Combat-wise. everything has been overhauled and feels fluid and seamless. A joy to experience.I have to tell you though, if you are a new player, you will suffer unless you are willing to slog through or be a wallet warrior (initially); To get those mods, weapons and frames to sustain your play through and serve as the foundation to farm everything else. For a free to play game, there are no paywalls, most things can be grinded, there is however a time wall, frames for instance take up to three days to build from individual components ( not counting the time to craft and farm them). But is par for the course, you can rush with in game Platinum ( that you spend real money to get). They have to get your cash somewhere.Some tips: I have to highlight this to new players especially since many fall into this trap:THERE  IS PLAYER TO PLAYER TRADING, SAVE YOUR PLATINUM FOR THATThe only thing you should spend IRL money/Platinum get in store is cosmetics that you really like, for everything else you can almost certainly advertise in Trade Chat.If you do try out Warframe and get over the initial hump: join an established clan to get access to dojo weapons, be prepared to grind void for the fortnightly Baro visits, enjoy the story missions, and follow in game lore to find out what you are in the ""Second Dream"".With that, see you in game, Tenno.

Each gun is lovingly crafted and feel unique and powerful when firing.  It's challenging, but you never feel punished for those time you are killed.This is by far the best example of the genre bar none.(Play with a mic - it makes the game much more intense and exhilarating)",Rhysy2706,http://steamcommunity.com/id/Rhysy2706

The charm of the first is lost though this doesn't make it a bad game, at its core Portal 2 is a simple puzzler in an FPS shell and offers a great distraction to more indepth games.Its definately not Half Life type awesomeness and I guess you need to expect that - though I would sacrifice both Portal games for another entry into the Half Life Universe.

Nah!I killed the Michael Bay turdles as Jake the Dog. â‘¨/BAKA Would fight againGoat simulator is the perfect way to show your hatred to Michael Bay!Okay, time to be serious.All this game is designed for is to kill time. That's all. Nothing else.This game, surprisingly, is doing a damn good job on that.Seriously, whenever i play this game, i could lose 1 hour of life so quickly.I am not kidding. TF2 would usually waste my time little by little. But this game kills more time.Maybe it's because of how many things you can do in this game.Until i'm soooo bored of this game, i'm just gonna headbutt people. It's suprisingly fun to do!Lately, i haven't been playing this game because i was too busy with other stuff.And now, i might have a chance to play it again.To all of the people who wants excitement, great characters and non-glitchy games, don't buy.Only those who seek true comedy should buy this gold.Ramming people has never been so much fun!

The game throws you straight into action, whereby nearly any monster in the game is able to kill you in about 2-3 hits. Dark souls is brutally honest through. If you die, it maybe because of a monster, or a npc you accidently attacked, but it's not impossible. It's the game telling you your bad, not it.

Be prepared to put a few hours in to get it working well.After that I made the mistake of playing this for the story. For me it was an atrocious experience.If you want to play around in a city sandbox and are willing to put the time in to get it running then it is brilliant.However I would warn you away from the base game and point you to the expansions instead.  They are much less painful and come much more highly recommended.If you want a GTA game that is pure fun in solo play then Vice City is a better choice.If you want fun multiplayer go for GTA V.,76561198034823626,http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198034823626

Even if you don't really like Minecraft or Gmod this is still brilliant just to smash stuff into other stuff, even the main menu's background is just people making stuff crash into each other, on purpose. I would even recommend you buy it just for the smashing.This game will work even on old computers (to some extent, of course) as well as on top-notch ones (i just reallised I've used ""Minecraft"" as an example and then ""top-notch"" What a coincidence).  BUT , if you are experiencing lag, (well, at least enough to make it anoying) there are only to ways easy ways to fix it, (hopefully). Both are found in the graphics section of the options, but you may find an annoying problem, one of them does hardly anything performance wise (at least I think so, maybe i just don't notice), and the other will decrease the quality of the entire screen (and just incase you're wondering, no, I don't mean permanently, just how the game will be displayed on the screen) which has a much more noticable improvement to performance. BUT KNOW THIS , performance in Space Engineers all, and I mean all, depends on what it has to simulate. It may be seem fine when you are just building a very simple structure, but when you have some small spacecraft inside the hanger of a huge mothership, and then  fly it straight into an asteroid at full speed  even the best commercially available computers can have a hard time surviving all those computations going on at once. What is the result? A game that is great, awesome, really realistic, but can also be extremely CPU intensive.But overall, it is still great, even if it does run a bit slowly (whether or not this is sarcasm doesn't really matter, both work good here), it is worth the money, and the lag (if any, of course, as this varies depending on the circumstances). It is brilliant.And just for the sake of it:  ""Live long and prosper"" - Spock",Lord_Zarnox,http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lord_Zarnox

However, there are many bugs within the current alpha builds. Many of the core content available on the mod is also not available in this standalone version. Buying an early access game has risks and if you want to support the development of the game, I strongly recomment just keep in mind that it isn't the developers problem if you encounter glitches. The game also lacks an end game and thus once most people found decent loot, the game turns into a deathmatch or a hunt for new spawns. Overall a decent title that is worth your money as long as you dont mind investing money into an alpha and encountering a few glitches.TL:DR- Good game- Very addictive- Buggy and glitchy- Not much of an end game- CURRENTLY IN ALPHA",TSGStosh,http://steamcommunity.com/id/TSGStosh

I do not regret buying this game at all, in fact it is probably my favourite game this year, I own my fair share of games on steam, over 200, yet it is very rare that one of these games will be played for more than 2 - 3 hours, what i'm trying to say is that i have definitely spent more money on less gameplay, if you are sure that this is the kind of game you enjoy, BUY IT NOW, it is well worth it, i'm not even half way through all the content, if you dislike stealth games, i would proceed with caution, there isn't much story here, though for sale price i'd say its worth the leap of faith as it's controls are stellar, especially compared to previous metal gears, the controls are fluid, the graphics are incredible, the port is nearly perfect, yet the content will last you anywhere between 5 minutes to 50 hours. In conclusion i'd give this game an 8.5/10 objectively speaking, but personally i'd go as far as a 9.5, this is exactly what i wanted and i knew what i was getting walking in, which is a short yet solid stealth game with tons of replayability.tl;drMETAL GEAR FANS - NO BRAINERSTEALTH FANS - GREATNON STEALTH FANS - KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GETTING INTOI RECOMMEND FOR ANYONE",Mofflang,http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mofflang

51224,,No ratings yet,304050,,Posted August 7.,"This game had so much potential on the day it was created with alot of fanbased projects. It really got the community going when it was first released and this game had a lot of potential. Trove is basically World Of Warcraft and Minecraft. The concept of MMORPG grinding is still there and there is the block building, breaking and making idea implemented in the game as well. Trove started to become a game loved by the community and Trion decided to add in more Pay To Win options in every single update. This is very true and Trion will probably never change it. After you zoom in to about 50 hours of the game, a few hundred dollars can change you from early game to late game. Their ingame purchase benefits are crazy and a few dollars spent makes up for a few days of grinding. Major in game benefits and boosts such as ""Patron"" (Which is like membership) costs IRL money and increases bonus stats by a crazy amount. However, Trove has ""tried"" to conceal the fact that they are money hungry beasts and added in a feature where each day has a different bonuses so free to play players can grind. This bonus doubled and increased if you have Patron, making Patron an extremely game changing thing. However, although Pay to Win is a major problem, free to play players can still thrive if you have hundreds of hours to burn monthly... To get to about mid game, Trion is only asking you to grind your soul out. It really isn't much of a big deal. (Note the sarcasm) Once you get to about mid game, you make very little progress daily even if you play a lot. Tge new level update to make the maximum level from 20 to 30 is so grindy. Now all the pay to win problems have been covered, I can now talk about the gaming bits of the game. As i said before, this game has the basic concepts of a fun MMORPG with dungeons and raids to do. This game doesnt really require much teamwork but farming in big groups would be ideal and easier. The hardest raids can be soloed sometimes and there are hardly any boss mechanics. A game like World of Warcraft or RIFT has raids and dungeons that requires strategic battle plans such as tanking, healing, pulling, aggro, dps, kiting, timing and positioning. Although tanking is required in the game and dps is as well, it doesnt really feel as exciting as an actual Raid or dungeon where you feel like you have contributed to the DPS charts. A carry can easily be invited into your raid and they can just one hit the bosses extremely quickly. After the tutorial of the game, there are hardly any more quests to complete which makes it boring becuase all you do in the game is Shadow Tower (Raids) and Dungeons. Adding in questing would really make the game alot stronger than it is and it really needs to be for a Pay To Win Game. Adding a questline would put more excitement and make the game more interesting. The biggest power rank booster in the game are gems, which at a certain point of the game is extremely hard to get in lots of amounts. To progress onto the worlds, you either sell your soul to the demon or spend $30. Trion really needs to rethink about how the game will be updated. The amount of hours you will spend grinding on this game will become unbelievable if you want to proceed to the end game stages and levels. Don't touch this game and want to goto end game in a few months unless you're allowed to drain mum's credit card.When i say it like this, i'm not even joking, just play this for fun. It's meant to be fun for the first 100 hours. ",tadlicated,http://steamcommunity.com/id/tadlicated

Sniper Elite Nazi Zombie Army is a standalone version of a Sniper Elite v2, and as most of the games futuring zombies, this game is meant to be coop. It's way more interesting playing in 4 characters, rather than playing alone as game tends to get frustrating if you are playing it solo. The difficulties are hard, but what this game wants from you is to make tactic for each level that will determin on if you are gonna succeed or not. Of course, upon playing with your friends, the enemies are stronger, and you have to apply different attitude towards threats. Anyway, I would recommend this game if you have even one friend to play it with, but if you have more, it's always better. Sniper Elite Nazi Zombie Army is what I think Call of Duty Zombies mode should've been, with this fluid campaign.7/10",gamerexq,http://steamcommunity.com/id/gamerexq

I started playing this game a few days ago and it was alright, despite some FPS issues and buggy animations in some official servers. I was planning to give this game a thumbs up, however after the 1.0.1.1 patch its literally impossible for me to join an official server due to the fact that all servers are in the US. Thus, everytime I join I get kicked for high ping (+200) since I play from Oceania region. Thereby, I cannot recommend this game as of now.Here are some improvement suggestions to devs:*Add official servers in Oceania region for South East Asian, New zealand and Australian players*Fix FPS issues on maps like Rooftop and Colosseum due to excessive spawning of zombies and bandits*Enable achievements for single player mode",haoliu98,http://steamcommunity.com/id/haoliu98

VERY Good.Not only has Ubisoft created this intense FPS, they have also managed to increase the player base over all 3 platforms (Xbox, Playstation and PC).Pro's:-Great Mechanics.-Somewhat realistic damage (1 headshot from any weapon will instakill)-Hit Detection is better than most game *cough* TF2 *cough*.-Steep learning curve. -Is not P2W.-BattlEye (anti-cheat).-Sounds.Why is a steep learning curve good? You won't get bored within 10 hours of gameplay. Now having said that you do have to unlock all your operators (you automatically have 1 free operator when you start, the recruit). The price of you operators will vary on your version of the game, for instance, if you have the starter edition all operators are 25k renown (100-600 per match, 100 if you were â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and 600 if you did will and a boost) and if you have the normal version your operators will cost 500 - 1000 - 1500 - 2000. <What does that mean? Your first operator will cost 500, and each successive operator will cost an extra 500 renown.Con's:-Connection problems.-I have never joined a server with less than 100 ping. (I'm in Australia so meh)-Rubber banding even at 100 ping.-Glare and buggy light.-Buggy collision (drones falling under maps and getting stuck in stairs.-People who don't have mics.Overall this game is 9/10.I recommend to get this game if you have a mic.

Well, well, I have just the thing for YOU, dear small hireling. This game, Borderlands 2.Borderlands 2 is a shoot-em-up loot-em-up kind of game. If you want to be successful, you gotta scavenge for new guns constantly. Otherwise, well, how are you going to defeat Handsome Jack if you can't take on a single psycho?Oh right, speaking of Handsome Jack, you're needed to defeat that guy. Long story short, he's a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ who wants to open the VERY same Vault you intend to open. He runs Hyperion, is merciless, yada yada yada, but you're going to give him one, and by one I mean a bullet to the face. The story is excellent.But you may be asking, ""Portable Toaster, oh bringer of news, do I need to have good graphics card or serious humour? What if I have a crude sense of joking?"" Hahah, welcome home, friend. The game runs surprisingly smooth for what it's worth, and as for the humour, if you enjoy laughing at a blindsided robot falling off a cliff, a maniac exclaiming that he has a finger pizza for you or anything along those lines, you're needed here in Borderlands 2.Onto who you'll actually be! Whether you choose to be an ex-army Commando, a mystical Siren, a strongman Gunzerker, a number, a schoolgirl Mechromancer or Meat Bicycle Man, you're going to have a ton of fun. As long as you have a friend, good times are to be had for sure!But then you go on, ""Portable Toaster, do I look like the guy who'd have friends?"" Oh. Uh. Well, you can play solo, I guess. I'll just put this out there, though, I was given control of the vehicle by my friend and as soon as he got in, I ran off a cliff accidentally. Honest. But there is fun to be had in Single-Player. Don't worry if you have friends who can't afford the game, you'll still have a blast.

11557,1 person found this review funny,87 of 127 people (69%) found this review helpful,383870,,Posted February 11.,"I don't really care enough to write reviews, but this game I found genuinely dissapointing. I saw it on sale for about $16 the day before it's release. I remember seing the E3 presentation of the game and thought ""Hey, seems like it could be a nice mystery game with decent decision making that would effect the outcome along with some rather pleasent to listen to voice acting"". So I had an interest in this title. But, did it fare to my expectations? Nope. Here's why.Now I am going to avoid spoilers, because I respect that some will want to give this a shot themselves, but I strongly recommend waiting for a sale. Like $5.00 sale. I'm going to start off with the pros, because despite my over-all disappointed there are some commendable attributes.Pros:+Voice acting - This is definitly the golden prize of the game. Interactions between Henry (Rich Sommer) and Delilah (Cissy Jones) are engaging and rather entertaining. It definilty does a good job and genuinely making you feel involved in the characters relationship.+Soundtrack - The ambient acoustic guitar throughout the game never got tedious and kept me enthralled and quite relaxed. +Art Style - A rather pretty lookng game, I definilty sense heavy inspiration of Team Fortress 2 especially in player model (A modded asset from Team Fortress 2). Environment is pretty to look at. But ultimately feels kind of lifeless.+Story (Acts one and two) The sense of mystery surrounding the game specifically in the first two acts,  definilty made a rather intense on-the-egde of your seat impact. It was what drove me to keep playing till the end. But, this is where I get into the cons.Cons:-Not enough depth - I thoroughly enjoyed the first 40 minutes of playing. I initially felt the game could've had a lot to offer in terms of exploration. I mean, look at the map when you first get into the lookout. It seams plentiful, like there'd be a lot to find and discover. But unfortunately there's northing really to keep from following the rather linear pathway to keep the story rolling. I didn't get the flashlight till near the end of the game and I pretty much didn't even need  it. -Lifeless - When you start off and come across an Elk and then a  tree scratched to â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ by a Grizzly, I thought ""Huh, maybe there'll be an encounter with a Grizzly"". Nope. Asside from the gran-total 3 npcs to come across, there is very little wildlife present in these woods. Even though the game warns of these encounters, they never occure. Ever.-Length - Having finished the game in only 3 hours, I finally understand Angry Joes contempt for short â™¥â™¥â™¥ titles, I've often avoided them because they aren't worth the asking price. I honesltly hoped this would've been a bit longer. 8 - 9 hours atleast. -Illusion of choice - One thing the game did interestingly was the choices of dialogue between Henry and Delilah but ultimiately this was meaningless and has little impact on end-game. Even the text based intro makes no difference whatsoever except for a naked sketch of you depending on how you choose pose. That's it.-Ending sucked - A game presented like this, at least could've had multiple endings.... There's only two and they're both exactly the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing same. All in all, I give this game a 4 out of 10. It's not really worth $20, if on sale for like $5:00 and you enjoy dialogue heavy games then maybe give it a shot.

If you have completed BL2, I still don't think this game is worth buying UNLESS it is discounted for 70%+. In my first playthrough, I got less than 15-20 hours with some sidequests, yet in BL2 u get twice as much (but nothing compares to BL2). The gameplay itself feels no different to BL2, despite the new mechanic of the 'Butt-slam' and low-grav. You never really find yourself running out of O2 and the Butt-slam is worthless. You may as well be trying to kill people with Zer0's unforseen if you want to use this mechanic lethally.Pros:-New weapon type (it's exciting until you actually try it and you're like....oh....)-New element-New characters (Claptrap!)-Finally we get the Moon dlc we've always wantedCons:-Short as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥-Reused models (probably the biggest part of this game after completion besides replaying is hunting down uniques)-None of the new features (low-grav, cryo, lazers) are actually good, they're just enticing-Raid-boss mission after the main story is just the last boss again (laziness)-Barely any areas (although most are pretty big, around Wildlife Exploitation size)-Character to character interactivity is crappy (maybe Claptrap is an exception)I wouldn't recommend buying this game at all unless it was on sale.",jtrkyr,http://steamcommunity.com/id/jtrkyr

There seems to be a shocking trend for big game cross platform developers to neglect keybinding in PC games. Some PC gamers have a setup that is not easy to remove a joystick for various reasons, joysticks are not easy to disable on a window system. These new games see  joysicks as a gamepad and use buttons and any axis across any or all of the attached joysticks and disable the keyboard alltogether making the game unplayable.

43162,,No ratings yet,218620,,"Posted December 9, 2013.","Payday 2 is a four-player cooperative first person shooter which is a sequel to Payday: The Heist. This game involves up to a team of 4 players performing bank heists and robberies. Gameplay has been HEAVILY (and I mean HEAVILY!) improved and expanded since its predecessor. Instead of running-and-gunning, more emphasis is put on the cooperation of players. Using unique abilities such as stealthing, as opposed to a noisy approach rewards players with better paydays, making this game suitably enjoyable for both the casual and hardcore gamers! :)The game features character skill levelling, to be added into customisation skill trees of choice: Mastermind, Enforcer, Technician, or Ghost; all of each has its role and has individual unique traits and abilities that can be mixed-matched per player's preference. Not one skill tree can be said to be better than the other, and this is massively important in co-op. It focusses on having a team of players who specialise in separate skill trees, to successfully complete missions.Unlockable weapons (gun-mods!) and masks (patterns and materials!) makes the game rewarding and even more addictive and exciting.Huge NOTE to point out:Overkill Software are constantly balancing out skill trees, adding new weapons and masks, as well as missions as time goes by to keep players engaged in the game. The developers have done an amazing job in making the game much MUCH better than its predecessor. There is not one feature I can think of that has not superceded those of Payday: The Heist. The fact that Overkill software is such an amazing company makes buying the game and supporting the developers worthwhile.Hopefully more updates to come!

17194,,3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful,236870,,Posted April 3.,"First off, I'm going to add a positive review for this game to balance out all the unfair negative reviews. I want to being by saying that the actual game itself is nothing short of a masterpiece. If you enjoyed Blood Money's massive sandbox expanse, with numerous methods of assassination, then this is definitely going to be enjoyable for you. It is a substantial departure from the linearity of Hitman: Absolution.However, it is far from the perfect game. I will agree with a lot of the points raised by those who have posted a negative review, which are:-Always-Online DRM (which causes kickbacks to the main menu if you disconnect)-Confusingly unnecessary 'Episodic' model-Poor PC performance & optimisationJust keep in mind, that the game itself is not the problem. The game itself is actually incredibly enjoyable, and that is how we will feel about it in a year's time, when the game is complete. The issues all arise from temporary issues. (poor optimisation , always-online DRM [which unfortunately will not likely be changed] and the lacklustre business model.)I will add to this review later.TL DR: The game is good, but the release hasn't been. Buy it next year if you're patient. And open your eyes and stop giving it terrible reviews.",blur_reqz,http://steamcommunity.com/id/blur_reqz

These puzzles include the use of jumping/gliding, explosives, grappling hooks, slowing time and portals. The first part of the game you will be also doing a few cool arenas with different objectives such as aerial kills and protecting zombies.Bosses are really fun and have really cool mechanics, if you liked raiding it WoW I would defiantly recommend thisThere are only a few bad things I can say about this game.

21347,,No ratings yet,8930,,Posted July 4.,"This game is so much fun. If you want to call it a board game its the best board game Ive played on a computer. Do not let it looks fool you. For several years ive been looking at this game but because it didnt look ""exciting"" or ""too complicated"" I resisted it. I finally gave it a shot and wish I got it sooner! Still yet to play with people but single player is still really fun. The game may look confusing but its quite simple and not too hard to pick up. A very very good strategy game indeed. You start as a early civilization and have several ways to win but in short become the best and most prosperous civilization in a certain area military, technolgically, religously etc. Its all a race to see who is better. But Beware! this game is such a time waster what may seem minutes into the game can be hours in real life! Last point to make is that the DLC is worth it! Itll extend the fun in this game for twice maybe 3 times as long! New ways to play and new civilizations to try out as long as your friend has the same DLC as well but you can always toggle them on/off when needed. If you love strategy board games that is a real time waster and even have other people that are willing to try this game GET IT!

Then, when you go higher and higher through the tiers, you look at things differently. ""I must build a better robot to kill the other robot!"" you think to yourself. But then, you realise that there is only one good robot shape. The gunbed. Soon, the game loses the charm it once had in tiers 1-3. You no longer see a giant white â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ or a ridiculously large tower. It gets worse. I spent $5 on this game. Then, I was so overpowered, I didn't feel like playing anymore.

I was young and didn't really have my gaming consoles anymore because of my brothers and I had a really bad pc, which i still own. TF2 was one of the games i could play pretty well on this pc but with horrid graphics, but it was one of the more fun games I installed. I met some real cool and nice people on this game as well as people who i plan to keep by my side. The community back then was more humble compared to nowadays. You have competitive gamers who spam their bind keys with unfunny/gross jokes and very obnoxious people who are either yelling at you or telling you to do specific things to win the game. When really, it doesn't even matter if you win or lose. However, you also have those people who are really awesome and you may meet some nice friends along the way! Although you never know what kinda person you're going to meet on this game. In my honest opinion, if you want to have a game to just waste time on (and money) or just mess around with people you know (which is what I do now), this is perfect. Esspecially the mann vs. machine co-op. I mainly play that now. Although to me, the game lost its touch, update wise, and I moved onto other games. I believe it's worth a shot to try it out but other than that, I'd keep it as a casual game. I don't think the competitive scene is worth getting into anymore because it's being flooded by crude people. Atleast from my experiance after over about 4+ years of playing it just got worse and worse. You will eventually be tied into drama even if you try to avoid it. You'll be more stressed than actually having fun, I'll tell you that!Although in all seriousness, this game is losing its touch and probably isn't worth making it your main game MAINLY because the updates they've been releasing are becoming very dull and not as great as they used to be. BUT, it's a great game to just play to pass the time and have fun! All you'll really notice nowdays is...people really love to trade more than actually play. Living off as a free to play would be very tough and you'd need to be patient with items you would want, unless you got that MONEY! Hope this helps.One last thing, I am not saying this game is bad in any way. I am saying that it's worth trying and playing with friends, or even meeting people! Although there are some downsides that you won't like, such as some stuff I pointed out above. Strictly towards the community. I personally think you should have this game as a side game rather than your come home to play sorta thing. Have it as a once in a while game, because it's nothing to be big about, unless you really do not like most of the millions of other games out there. Just give it a shot and see what you think! Have fun <3",welcometosuplexcity,http://steamcommunity.com/id/welcometosuplexcity

The downside is it hasn't recieved too many game changing updates in awhile other than the anti-cheat system but that's about to change with the engine update coming out awhile from now, which will make the developers have the ability of implimenting new content such as maps and game modes. It can also be somewhat difficult for new players considering the people with thousands of hours will basically demolish you in most scenarios, but given time you can learn.(Also customization really only kicks in when you eirther get premium through events or purchase it with real money, which is rather unfortunate)Summary: Solid game with great content and customization but limited unless you have premium and is also difficult to beginners.",iSkulz,http://steamcommunity.com/id/iSkulz

Since last reviewing this I have continued to improve and have found myself enjoying the game so much more. Warframe feels like a home, the game I always come back to after playing other games and it always has something to offer me.At this current time I own at least one of every warfame, either primed or non-primed versions, and have enjoyed playing them all. Note that most of my game experience has been had while playing as either Excalibur, Volt Prime or Frost Prime.I feel now that warframe is not only greatly customisable, and still Improving, that I feel I can now specialise myself in different ways. All my loadout slots have a speciality or an archetype. You may say I'm limiting myself but this is how I choose to play. I said in my original review that there wasn't quite enough to specialise in, but I now feel otherwise.Something that feels perfect to me now is Warframe is getting more cinematic and lore friendly quests, mainly beginning with Natah, and I feel as though there is a much better narrative to the game, that while I did not feel it was required, I do love the addition of.The pay model is my favourite thing as it is basically ""Pay if you are not patient"" as it still seems to me that you can get everything you want, save maybe a few cosmetic items, by just playing the game and knowing where to be and when.To my favourite point about this game, Digital Extremes is still keeping me, personally, hyped. Usually what they add is something that I have been thinking ""Warframe would be so cool if it had X"" for example the upcoming weapon sheathing customisation. While a small thing to mention it does make me excited for almost every update, the only one letting me down being Sands of Inaros, but following such a big update as The Second Dream this couldn't really be avoided.Pros:A great game to play aloneA great game to play with friendsFantastic customisation to warframes and their coloursFun WeaponsFun WarframesEasy enough for new gamersChallenging enough for veteransCons:Conclave can be toxic (I do not blame DE for this one)Dark Sector as they are now, and as it seems they are to becomeNew Warframes appear to be stagnating slightlyOverall I reccomend Warframe to try, while it may take a while to really feel it you will feel like this game is everything you want. It's a love it or hate it game I say. Well done DE, well done.",RaikoSurik,http://steamcommunity.com/id/RaikoSurik

This game is so much fun to play. The game has the ability to grab you and take you into a world full of assassins and betrayal. This game is excellent but there are a couple of downsides. The tutorials are next to pointless. It is impossible to instantly know which button to press when it tells you to because they don't tell you which key to press, just a symbol representing it, which I found irritating and pointless. I also believe that this game really should've included Steam achievments and trading cards. There is something about some games that when you complete a difficult challenge or play for a couple of hours you feel you deserver some sort of reward to sow your friends your acomplishments. But maybe that's just me. Apart from these setbacks, I am thoroughly enjoying this game and I cannot wait to find out what happens next.",themajesticlemon,http://steamcommunity.com/id/themajesticlemon

Things are often hard starting out; the learning curve is quite steep and the currency can be difficult to earn. But once you get the hang of things, it's awesome: the massive battles, the tight-knit tactical play, the teamwork...Socially it's the best game experience I've had, though it can be lonely if you don't join up with an outfit. I've met a great many awesome and talented people who are a pleasure to work with. Defeating a force far larger than your own due to squad coordination is hard to beat. Leading is taxing, but rewarding when your men listen and you get the job done.It's not all sunshine and rainbows of course. There are some really bad days when your faction is getting spawn camped left and right, or you consistently get killed every 10 seconds. Faction balance isn't as good as it could be, the monetary prices for everything is quite steep, and optimisation could still use some work.That being said, it's the epic moments, the guys I play with, and the general experience that keep me coming back after over 700 hours (direct client + Steam).",BlackBulletIV,http://steamcommunity.com/id/BlackBulletIV

Ok yes it's a bit of a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ move to ask your customers to pay for an addon when the game is still in Early Access but i'm going to be honest. I Paid $30 for a moderate game that was just starting out. It was interesting but was unable to hold my attention for a long period of time. I took a brake from it. Came back to it last week. There is a huge amount of changes, new dinos, new objects new biomes etc. Theres moving bases now, either via raft or via platform on the back of a dino. This is a huge upgrade to when i initially played ARK. People are complaining about a new DLC, i can't say im happy about paying for the new DLC but, so far i haven't. I may come to buy it in time, but there is more content, unique effects. Different dinos as well as different mechanics in the DLC, not to mention an entire new F'ing world. I don't remember them ever saying there was going to be another world at all. Now there are 3? One of which is completely free, one comes with the game and one you have a pay for. The price is a bit high on the DLC but it's not cheap to make an entire world. There is no pay to win, There is no micro transations, how exactly do you think they are going to pay staff to add more content for you to play without paying them?I would also like to state that this game is a modder's Heaven. Not that many games support mods these days sadly. This game does have the development tools required to make some great mods, which i do use. Ok the initial content may run dry after a while. However the community is giving so much content to this game that is all free to enjoy. This is my first modded playthrough and i'm having a ball with it. Also worth noting is that the newer maps basically arn't finished yet. There are bugs and issues that some modders have run into, but ""The Island"" the original map is supported fully. TL;DR: Honestly i believe this game is great, the DLC outrage is not warrented, especially as its far from required. almost 100 hours playtime here and never touched the free map let alone the paid one. Great game with one of the best modding communities i've ever seen. Pick it up.",AkkarinDarkmoor,http://steamcommunity.com/id/AkkarinDarkmoor

The lack of variety in enemies is kinda eh, but otherwise this has been a really good purchase.Pros:- it 'feels' like a member of the franchise, if that makes sense - more than the third game did- the flow of play is really good - you can clamber around, climb most scenery, combat is fluid and super fast like the old games- multiplayer is fun & has a lot of customisation options- the map editor (snapmap) is REALLY awesome and employs a super cool visual scripting function- A+ multiplayer taunts- throwbacks to the other games in the franchise- really good sound design (apart from the repetitive moaning of enemies if you're above them)Cons:- the campaign can get a little repetitive, chalking this down to lack of variety of enemies and sometimes glory kill can be OP- a bit slow to load, but it is a new release- exiting the game to switch modes is kinda tiresome b/c of aforementioned loading times- no matchmaking in multiplayer really",serafiki,http://steamcommunity.com/id/serafiki

14953,,3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful,275850,,Posted August 13.,"No Man's Sky is a very fun and addictive game. Full stop.**Don't read this paragraph if you don't care about my thoughts on the negetive feedback.**All the reviews about frame rate are probably people in the minority. Let's face it, If you're enjoying a game I doubt you take the time to write a review on it, carefully critiqing all the problems whilst adding positives. Most, MOST of the people writing bad reviews are people who are upset at losing $59 becuase their PC cannot handle the game. This is just simply because they are upset, powerless and mad so they rant about every bad detail about the game spouting not to buy it. If the game worked they would probably not write a review.(I have a GTX 1070 and It runs everything on maximum at 60+ frames. (I have not tested above 60 frames because my monitor does not support higher.))Gameplay:The game starts you off in your own galaxy where you get to skip around naming and discovering things as you please. If you don't like adventuring and prefer to stick to quests in a linar form, do not buy the game, this is not Star Citizen early acess. The amount of glee and joy I simply get from seeing that something I found is now entitled to me and anyone who stumbles accross it will see my name is amazing, there are no words to describe the exitement it brings. Everything is easy to understand and discovering things other players discover only spark more curiosity points for me.Space Stuff:Traveling in space is allright I guess. The ship controlls are alittle clunky and slow if you're using a mouse (I recomend having a controller plugged in just for flying.) Space travel is fair and not abusable as you need quite a rare material to travel further. Space battles are immensly fun, Almost as goot as SC.Extras:The music in the game is amazing. It knows exactally what to play when and how I will react to hearing it. I love it.The menu is very similar to that of Destiny for the Xbox and PS4.There is still alot this game can offer. If you don't know if you should buy it, don't. The game will only get cheeper as more stuff is added.This game at current for me is a 9/10.It's my opinion, if you don't like it then you don't have to listen.",_MAK_,http://steamcommunity.com/id/_MAK_

Beautiful graphics coupled with a brilliant Home Cities system ensure that AoEIII lives up forever to be one of the better RTS titles in recent times. The Asian Dynasties expansion pack was definitely the real gem in this pack. A major letdown was the absence of historial campaigns which were a staple of 1 and 2. While the story campaigns weren't awful, they bordered on mediocrity and at times, childishly cliche' and odd, trying to desperately interwine historical events/characters into its plot. Ultimately, being a hardcore Age of Empires fan and a hardcore veteran of AoE2 & Mythology, AoE3 still captured my interest as an alternate RTS choice outside of my Starcraft/C&C sessions. 8.5/10 (Complete Collection), 8/10 - Vanilla, 7/10 - War Chiefs, 9/10 - Asian Dynasties.",commandochou,http://steamcommunity.com/id/commandochou

Comparing this to ETS2, I would say that this game has several improvements in terms of gameplay. One of which is the new trailer parking options. I find it very pleasing to be able to choose how you would like to park the trailer.The trucks themselves are quite different from the trucks in ETS. The trucks in this game have long bonnets, and I find it rather difficult to turn since I am used to the bonnet-less European trucks from ETS.Moving on to the map. The map in this game is still small compared to the map in ETS2.

Although we only have Episode One as of this review, it's safe to say that Telltale has done an incredible job and I cannot wait to see more episodes and perhaps even future seasons.  Pros  Immersive as hell. The atmosphere, story, character development, everything was amazing.  Detective work. Incredible voice acting all around. Really digging Troy Baker as Bruce Wayne/Batman. It's a Telltale Batman game. That speaks for itself. Fight scenes in this are amazing. Camera angles, the intensity, everything about them make you feel like the Batman.  Choosing your plan of attack is awesome. Hope to see this feature used more in future episodes.  Cons   Performance issues. Won't dwell on this too much, has already been discussed to death. Not really a con but, first episode was a little slow paced. I personally didn't mind this but some may be a bit put off by the large amount of dialogue. Overalll Score: 8.5/10.Once future patches are released that deal with the current performance issues, I Strongly reccomend purchasing this. Personally, it is my favourite Telltale Game since the first season of The Walking Dead. Adding on from that, not everyone will face issues with running the game so I strongly suggest getting it to either give it a go or just wait until the patches roll on out. Strongly reccomend this game, get it whenever, you most likely won't regret it.",DeliciousPuddin,http://steamcommunity.com/id/DeliciousPuddin

We clean!If you have the time and patience and you feel like cleaning, this might just be the game for you! When I starting a map a said to myself ""I'm meant to clean all this up, really?"". About 30-40 minutes later and I looked back and thought to myself ""Well I've done a pretty good job, all nice and clean, guess I'll just exit the map and that'll all be a waste of time besides an acheivment I just earnt"".It's satifying though looking back and seeing how much you actually did to the map, but it has no meaning to it, you just clean up and leave then maybe come back another day and do it again for no reason.So it's probably not a game for everyone but if you like making things looking Extremley clean, you should give this game a go. You can always do before and after pictures so it's not like you did it for nothing.",wagzy,http://steamcommunity.com/id/wagzy

This game really has it all for me and cultivates an atmosphere that keeps me (and my discerning GF) coming back for more over and over and over again. The team work that it promotes, the user community, (most) of the players (awesome and friendly) and the back and forth action between stealthy movement and tense exploring (in hunt especially) following by often brutal, but fair, firefights (except that damn RPG), that are like living breathing things. I have rarely felt so immersed in a game as I do with Insurgency and I don't think in the 30+ years of gaming that I've done that I've put in any where near this many hours. I was shocked when I realized that I'd eclipsed my time on CS:GO, but after a moment of thought, was not really surprised. CS:GO is a great game and so are a lot of the other military FPS style games, but I really feel that no one has done so much on such a limited budget and resource group as Insurgency as... and for SO LITTLE MONEY!I have bought (through Steam and then Humble Bundle) no less than a dozen copies for friends and family to spread the goodness... and I'm a cheap old sod. :)Go out, get a copy and jump in to the fight... and don't forget to say 'hi'.",76561197971119511,http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197971119511

If you can get passed the highly debated Russian bias and are not concerned about putting in quite a few hours, you can learn alot about different aircraft and have a lot of fun in the process. There has been a bumpy road in the history of the development of this game, from crashes, to rendering bugs and graphical exploits. Most of this has been fixed with the introduction of the latest version of the Dakor engine, bringing new and more realistic looking tank models to the game, along with Nvidia waveworks - both have contributed to the game becoming much more immersive.My advice for new players who want to get a good look at what there is to offer, without starting at the crappy end (Arcade Battles - especially tanks) start off in Realistic if you feel up to the challenge. Arcade may be necessary for new individuals to get used to approximating distances and ranging. More XP, money and a greater respect for the finer elements with follow.In it's high moments, this game sits at an 8/10 for enjoyment.",MladshiyLlama,http://steamcommunity.com/id/MladshiyLlama

Sure, there are people that seem to have a genetic knack for quick judgement calls which turn out to be largely factual, but I'm not one of them. After starting Remember Me, I assumed I was playing another run-of-the-mill action adventure game, but before long I came to realise I was actually enjoying it.Set in a dystopian future, players assume the role of Nilin, a ""Memory Hunter"" who, ironically, has had her own memories stolen. Guided by the ever-present voice of Edge, the leader of the rebel group, Errorist Movement, Nilin must take down the Memorize corporation who, in controlling memories, effectively controls the population. I'm a bit of a sci-fi junkie, and the premise surrounding Remember Me is an interesting one. The futuristic setting of Neo-Paris is beautifully crafted, with great contrasts between the slums and affluent areas of the city, which makes the very linear nature of the game much more apparent. Sadly, exploring just isn't an option. The highlights of the game though, are definitely the ""Memory Remix"" scenes, where players need to tweak certain aspects of a person's memory to alter it. Unfortunately, you're only presented with a handful of opportunities to attempt this, and I think the game would have been better if more of the focus was on remixing memories. Aside from synaptic DJing, Nilin is also an adept hand-to-hand combatant, and the combat system does allow for a bit of tactical fun once all the combos and unique ""S-Pressen"" moves have been unlocked. It's not exactly complex, but there is some added depth to the button mashing. Overall, I think Remember Me is an enjoyable game, without being an innovative one. I'm glad I was off the mark with my initial assumption. I'd certainly recommend this to sci-fi fans, since the setting and story were part of the appeal for me.",geekmannerd,http://steamcommunity.com/id/geekmannerd

Great game to let a friend play and screw around in, this game delivers in being different, funny and absolutely ridiculous at times.",lesnak,http://steamcommunity.com/id/lesnak

This is a pay-to-progress title, and the devs are workgin on making it less and less so. By reducing the bonuses of being a premium member, they have decreased the in game money gain so everyone needs to farm. There is no reason to get mad when people pay up to $100 for a tank in a video game, it's their moeny and their choice. If this game was pay-to-win, then there would be things that only premium members can access that normal members can't. There are only 2 things that a premium member can access that a F2P member cant. Those are the extra inventory slots for your weapons, which is useless as you can only tkae a maximum of 3 weapons anyway as you cant carry too much weight. The second is an extra combat badge slot, to those who dont know what that is, you can equip 1 badge if F2P and 2 if you are a premium member, these give you small bonuses which dont affect the tide of battle. In saying that, they hardly affect a single soldiers gameplay that much, and can be countered easily with skill. All in all, don't be disgruntled by all the negative reviews from people whining about the game being pay-to-win because its really not. If you feel like you need a game to pass some time then give this a go and make your own call but dont review it after 60 hrs...

28750,,1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful,333930,,Posted June 1.,"As far as F2P shooters go, Dirty Bomb is possibly among the best out there. Highly recommended for people who want a good shooter to play for free.The features that set this above and apart all others are:- Very fair pricing: With minimal play time, it\'s possible to get a 50,000 credit hero permanently unlocked in 1-2 weeks. If you play each game mode every day and win once, you get 2,000 credits everyday and you can get 1,500-3,000 if you complete the objectives that cycle every 3 hours. No change in power above bronze cards.- High skill requirements: There\'s very little auto-aim (1 turret class) and a lot of hip-firing skill is required. Against snipers, small HP mercs move fast and there\'s ample flanking paths. Tank classes are usually balanced by slow movement or needing medics and fire support characters to feed them. - Massive focus on teamplay: Success is highly dependent on your team having a medic, fire support, engineer, assault and recon. At high levels you\'re going to need serious co-ordination between your team.- You can still carry: Despite the requirement for team-play, a good player is easily recognised in Dirty Bomb. You may not win but you\'ll make the other team pay hard. With enough skill, a medic could keep the entire team healed and push the opposition back.- Varied heroes: All mercs are functionally distinct and highly balanced. Each merc has specific loadouts and skills that contribute to the game.- Server browser: Wish other games had this. Negatives are:- Matchmaking: Sometimes you\'re going to up against stacked teams.- Loadout system: You have a fixed loadout that others may not like as it forces them into a specific weapon / augment they may not like. Fortunately, bronzes are relatively cheap. - RNG: You can select the hero that you want to get a loadout, but the cheapest path requires RNG. Special events also have a lot of RNG involved. However, you can buy a bronze loadout you want with in-game credits for 17,500 credits. - Minor glitches: I\'ve had a little rubber banding here and there. High ping players seem to teleport around every now and then. Nothing major. - Hackers: Relative to other F2P shooters, though, Dirty Bomb has a very low hacker problem. That said, it\'s not like there\'s no cheaters ever.",baroncrovax,http://steamcommunity.com/id/baroncrovax

This game is not one you can complain about when it comes to paying for items, there is no pay-to-win issue like some other games, all the items are available without the currency of a premium account. I have spent many hours on this game whether they be grinding in different ways for money or levels, or if there was a promotional code out and I was taking advantage of the x2 rewards amount.I wont say this game is perfect, as it is in Alpha right now, but for someone like me who easily notices flaws, I've found I love it. Fast matches with a fun game concept, and when everyone is the engineer, you can really see some fun designs or some smart ones.

44927,,No ratings yet,211600,,"Posted January 23, 2014.","Released in 1999 Thief Gold is the re-release of 1998's Thief: The Dark Project the wonderful game from the sadly now defunct Looking Glass Studios.  Originally Thief was known as Dark Camelot and intended to be an action RPG type of game and you can see throughout this game where they recycled content from that original game - ie medieval influenced missions.  it later morphed into Dark Project when they found that the stealth aspect (championed by Paul Neurath) was a lot more entertaining and that a game involving stealth and thievery would be a better option.Rather than being a straight re-issue of the game it was an early form of what we now know as GOTY editions. It includes 3 extra levels: The Mage Towers, The Thieves Guild and Song of the Caverns.  In addition to extra missions it also tweaked the standard missions some minor tweaks in most and then a couple of levels receiving reworking notably The Sword (added more area - ie Little Big World), Undercover (story changes), The Lost City (enemy and story changes) and Down in the Bonehoard is retextured.  Furthermore Thief Gold moves the version up to 1.37 from T:DP's final version of v1.33.  On the old discs you also got a preview of Thief II and of course the additional mission the Blooper Reel (Lord Baffords Manor featuring entertaining bugs and humorous content)At present the cut scenes do not function on some systems, notably Windows 7, there are various work arounds available - they can be found over at ttlg.com (file is called Tfix_1.18c) or if you so wish you can always Youtube the Thief cut scenes.  I highly recommend you watch the cut scenes, not only do they advance the story and reveal a lot of twists and turns related to it but they are also beautifully crafted and remain a joy to watch.The concept of Thief is simple, achieve the mission objectives by the use of stealth.  Stealth in this game pertains to use of shadows, sound and movement.  To aid you in this you have a light gem in the lower section of the screen that indicates the amount of light you are currently exposed in.  Sound is highly important and was one of the first games, if not the first where sound was just as important as what you could see.  Footsteps on varied surfaces, the sound of patrolling guards and ambient noise all add a rich and extra layer of gameplay.  You need to take these elements and work within them or bend them to your favour to achieve your objectives.The game is set within The City, a steampunkish type era, like the Victorian era on the cusp of industrialisation.  The City itself is moody, bleak and dangerous, the perfect playground for the adventurous. There are several factions within The City all vying for control, the mysterious Baron of the City remains aloof, a figure of power and control but not involved directly.  The ambience of The City is beautiful and it's success is largely due to the presentation of The City, both aurally and visually. The story that unwinds also fleshes out The City.Comparisons can be made to Dunwall from Dishonoured and Dishonoured does indeed play like a Thief game and has that ambience, albeit the focus is on assassination and not on stealth and theft.  Dunwall though is the victim of politics that goes up to the highest level, The City feels more alive though.   There is no apocalyptic plague sweeping the streets and the highest power is not overtly tyrannical but the various factions do give ""layers"" to The City, it feels like it has more depth and soul than Dunwall ever had, it is an entity in itself.The visuals are nothing exciting but they are effective enough.  The sound though is truly a thing of sublime beauty.  This is the first game where it was essential to have sound enabled and if possible to have a dedicated sound card (that again has kind of died out thanks to integrated sound on motherboards).  From the fabulous sound ambience to the classical Loot sound it is all very stylised and very integral to the Thief experience.  It must be said that the talents of the voice actor for Garrett, Mr Stephen Russell truly stand out as one of the greatest in gaming. He gives Garrett the very jaded, near misanthropic character that makes the game feel so immersive.  Garrett feels like what you would expect to be a product of hard life within The City it is conveyed wonderfully.  It is wonderful to hear Garrett go into his internal monologues during missions, throwing story, character and enjoyment at you.  Be warned though after sneaking through a level only hearing footsteps and ambience you may jump off of your chair in fright the first time his voice unexpectedly booms out at you. The difficulty levels change objectives and throw in variables such as not killing anyone and collecting a certain minimum amount of loot. At the easier difficulty levels it can be easy to roll in and kill all the enemies in a level, but by far the biggest challenge is to play on the Expert setting and try to adhere to the rules of Ghosting - ie don't let anyone see you, leave things as you found them (except for things you need to loot to achieve the objectives), don't knock anyone out even relock doors you pass through etc.. By and large the rules of Ghosting are self-imposed, a fun challenge to yourself, but a rewarding one.  Consider the missions (levels) to be a big playground at your disposal.The controls are standard controls for the era and you may find you will want to tweak them to match what you are used to playing today - ie alternating strafe and lean keys for instance and changing the walk and backwards buttons etc.  Combat is straightforward - use your bow to snipe targets or to shoot a variety of specialty arrows - water arrows to douse torches, moss arrows to soften the noise on surfaces, rope arrows to climb to other areas, fire arrows to destroy things, broad head to kill enemies/make a noise, noisemaker arrows to create a distraction etc..  The Sword play is simple, space to block and primary attack to swing the sword.  Hold it down for a stronger strike. By far the most useful tool though is the Blackjack.  This item is used to render guards unconscious.  Slip up behind a guard raise your blackjack and then bring it down upon their head.  Then get rid of the unconscious body - be aware that placing a body near a fireplace or in even a small amount of water will probably result in death to the unconscious party - bad if you are trying to achieve a no-kill objective.  So while dumping that body into an unlit fireplace may seem great, it won't be if a servant comes and lights it up :PAt the time of release the original Thief was described as a sneak 'em up (as opposed to shoot 'em up) and it is the precursor of all stealth games that you see today.  The graphics have not aged well, mods can fix that if you so choose and the controls can be quite archaic. But the story remains as beautiful as ever and there is a great deal of satisfaction to be garnered from this game. The reboot of the series, Thief, is to be released soon and while the reboot doesn't follow on from these stories - it certainly seems to take ideas from the series.If you enjoy stealth games, games with an interesting story and enjoy a challenge, then Thief: Gold is a game for you.  It does look dated now but it remains as enjoyable as ever to play.  Make sure you apply the fixes to get the cutscenes working (and improved resolution options) to really improve the gameplay experience for you. Tweak the controls as you need and you should find yourself become immersed in the depths of The City very quickly.  From the first time you pickpocket a guard of a key, hear that chiming loot sound or even your first close shave with your heart pounding in your throat you will be hooked on the game.  It really is a gem of gaming.",76561197970952528,http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197970952528

Whether you are sandboxing or playing Trouble in Terrorist Town, you will have lots of fun.This game has many pros. For starters, the incredible physics engine of Source combined with a sandbox game makes for some fun times. This game can be used for making animations, by spawning in ragdolls and positioning them where you want, and finally snapping a picture. You also get a lot for your $10 worth. Not only do you get sandbox (which is fun in itself) but you also have other games by the modding community build for Garry's Mod. These are games such as Stop it Slender, Trouble in Terrorist Town, Murder, Prop Hunt and many more. However, this game isn't perfect.This game has a few minor cons that are worth talking about. Firstly, if this is your first Steam purchase, or your first Source game purchase, you may run into a few problems. See, you need to buy a Source engine game. While that wasn't an issue for me (I personally got Steam for Portal once, now I use it much more) others may find themselves not being able to play GMod. Secondly, many of the games require Counter-Strike: Source. This was a problem for me, because I didn't want to pay  $20 for CSS. I was able to get the textures off the internet (legally!) and mod my game so this was fixed, however many users may not want to do this. Finally, when you first play this game, you may have no idea what it is exactly, and just play Sandbox, which can get very boring. There's no guide or help to tell you there's anything else to do.To summerise, GMod is a great game that will keep getting better as it is updated and as the community of modders and other Workshop creators alike grows. However, because of some minor issues, this game deserves an 8.3 out of 10. I recommend this game, and you should definately buy it.",2sBs,http://steamcommunity.com/id/2sBs

Overkill is an anti-consumer, pro-microtransactions company that spews out DLC like chips from a woodchipper. They have long abandoned all regard for the sense of honesty and the quality products they once had in their hands when they released Payday 1 - their practices today are the definition of good-gone-bad. Do not trust this company, and do not buy their products. Perhaps someday in the distant future they will be a reputable and honest company.",Eehee,http://steamcommunity.com/id/Eehee

They lied.When players were completing challenges for Crimefest 2015, Overkill promised that all content unlocked from the completion of challenges would be free. They lied.Screw Overkill.I mean, I really, really wish I could say that despite all that there is still a part of me that enjoyed the game, even after all this. And I tried and I tried - because I never played any other game as much as PAYDAY 2 up until that point. But the weapon balance they brought witht he pay-to-gain-the-advantage microtransactions made all the gunplay feel completely off, compared to what it used to be. Assault rifles are inaccurate and ineffective, and the pistols have all been turned into hand cannons. Concealment in stealth is now more reliant on how much your weapon skin buffs concealment than your skills and mods.I really still wish I could say ""despite all the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t, what's was always still great about this game was..."" but it's gone now.

That right there is an uneducated and ignorant summary of the indie masterpiece which is Terraria. While some of the concepts are alike Minecraft, it is unique in it's RPG elements and wide variety of items which is well over that of Minecraft's amount. With over 1000 different items and blocks, just under 20 NPCs, 100s of enemies and a charming retro artstyle, there is little I can find that disappoints me in this game. Gameplay is relatively simple and even though once you get up to the Frost Moon event you will still find new things to do. On top of that the game is actively being updated; with updates providing players with a hefty amount of new content. Multiplayer is good fun although I prefer the more easygoing experience of singleplayer. Like most games there are large public servers but you can easily make LAN and Private servers with the aid of programs such as LogMeIn Hamachi. Terraria is a relaxing, fun and unique sandbox; don't listen to the naysayers who shun this game because of it's small and irrelevant similarities to Minecraft.",greenclaweddragon,http://steamcommunity.com/id/greenclaweddragon

54704,,No ratings yet,209000,,"Posted November 25, 2013.","The Batman Arkham series has been critically aclaimed for it's fast paced action, fluid combat and above all because ""you're Batman"". Batman Arkham Origins is a prequel to the series and although it is not as revolutionary as the other two games I would say it is still a great addition to the series. This game features Batman meeting some of the Gotham super-villains for the first time such as The Joker, Bane, Deadshot and Black Mask. The graphics in this game are a step up from Arkham City and Batman has a new batsuit that looks more armoured. The combat remains the same with a few new gadgets such as the concussion detonator. The story is great, it starts with Black Mask putting a bounty of 50 million dollars on the death of Batman. Eight assassins take up the offer Bane, Deadshot, Firefly, Deathstroke, Shiva, copperhead, Electrocutioner and Killer Croc. I will not tell you more about the story for spoiler reasons but I can reveal that there is a massive twist. There are many bossfights and I must say they were all very good and polished compared to the Arkham City ones that were stun, beatdown,stun beatdown,stun beatdown, knockout. The one I enjoyed most was the copperhead bossfight when she drugged you and she made you see lots of her and you have to beat all the clones to harm the actual copperhead. This was reminiscent of the arkham asylum scarecrow fear gas hallucinations. There was a few bugs and glithches the first time I played through, one made me not able to complete the game, but these have been generally fixed with patches so it should be fine play right now. The multiplayer is a new addition to the series , which I did not have very high hopes for but it surprised me and I found I loved it. There are 3 teams 2v3v3 You are either Batman or Robin on one side and the other 2 teams are Joker's goons or Bane's goons. As batman or Robin you fly around, sorry glide around taking out thugs stealthily because only a few bullets can kill you, while you do this a meter is filling up for every takedown and if this meter is full then Btman and Robin win however this is very hard to do although it is fun silent takedowning (is that a word?) real people for once, not that I'd do it in real life(I've triedmit didn't work but I got a sharp slap from one of my brothers).The Gang's job is to capture posts and kill off the other team's reinforcement counter. If one of the gang's are killed off then the other gang wins.Once per game one person in the gang's will have a chance to play as Bane or The Joker which is also an enjoyable experience. Overall Batman Arkham Origins is very good. The game felt new at the beginning but then it just felt like a bigger Arkham city until you meet The Joker then it feels like a unique game again. WB Montreal has done enough taking over Rocksteady for this game to make it an enjoyable experience but some of the game just felt like the same S**t put into a new title but thankfully there was enough variation to make this game feel like it's own game although it is not revolutionary. If you liked the last 2 games you will love this game because it is more of what you love and then some. I give this game 7.4 out of 10. Thanks for reading and remember ""your batman"".",76561198082129284,http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198082129284

GG WM (Well Made). 5/5^ and that is the tl;dr of my review.Combat (Captain Mode) 5/5Captain mode is the Normal mode for this game. Out of 2 playthroughs (twice thru the 1st arc, and once thru the second arc), I can say I had no great issues. The last fight in the 1st arc was a fun challenge. Gameplay changes quite a lot depending on your unit investments (you spend cash earnt from scrapping enemies on weapon damage, accuracy, energy usage, HP, EP, and more). I usually set up my ship to fire two rounds of kinetics per turn. In the second arc, there are two battles which will feel impossible (and will be if you don't have the support units for it). The 1st difficult fight (in the second arc) is one of the three side missions. Do the other two first to rack in the cash. Then you can beat this side mission with enough game knowledge. The second hard mission, is just that there are TOO MANY ENEMIES! I mean seriously, TOO MANY ENEMIES JUST TO AMBUSH ONE CARGO SHIP! I WANT TO KNOW WHAT IS IN THAT BLOODY SHIP! Honestly though, the combat is fun. There are also 6 difficulty options that you can change in game, so if you get stuck on a mission, you have an easy way out. Or if it's to easy for the master tactician, then you can go be a flippin' space whale.Characters - 4.5/5Potential Waifus are all great. If you aren't happy with any of them, ask for a refun- Oh wait, it's free. Free Waifu is good Waifu.Seriously though, from justice loving, to perverted, to tsundere, to childhood friend, to shy, to patriot, and all the way to ""I only live to fight""; You have a large variety of waifu candidates.Story - 4.5/5*Prologue Spoilers*You're a Captain who's just minding your own business, testing out a prototype ship (welcome to Mass Effect, the VN. Comes with extra waifus), when the USSR invades. Nah, just kidding. It's just a lot of angry people being told that they should be angry at everything, and to vent that anger by shooting space lasers and rail guns at everything that isn't them. So, after a massive capital ship called Legion singlehandedly rips apart your local fleet, it then nukes your capital city. Obviously, you can either die fighting or live to fight another day, so you run for your mfern life. Then you gather allies (waifus) from all over the galaxy to smash the angry peasants that nuked your home. The story is enjoyable though. I enjoyed it.Style - 5/5Style? You have a kick-â™¥â™¥â™¥ ship, space lasers, space whales? Huh? Anyway, you have your own robot-piloting, waifu army. These bad girls have lasers, rockets, rail guns, swords and sidearms. They also disable capital ships, snipe rocket frigates, and download enemy porn collections? Urgh, that stupid pervert. What I'm trying to say is that this game is great.Since it's 100% free, get this awesome game.",76561198063180532,http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198063180532

Even though it's in early access, it's still aan amazing game so don't judge it too harshly. Just remember to save before you exit the game of you will lose all progress. The 'give feedback' optoin is a great addition to the game to help give the developers insight on what they need to still fix.Watch where you explore, there is quite the large range of fish and on the large end of the spectrum, there are quite the few, let's say, 'big' predators, but that's all the fun of it, just don't go too far especially not at night or you may not return... and only travel to the crash site with extreme caution.Good luck and safe exploring and let your underwater journey be filled with excitement and boat loads of fun (pun intended)",76561198052914690,http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198052914690

38601,,2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful,379720,,Posted June 1.,"Absolutely â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing savage, what a true DOOM reboot should be, and one of the best FPS games I have played in years. I have played DOOM since 1993 and still play and make maps to this day for the originals. So my review is based on how it it as a reboot to the series, and how it pits itself against modern FPS games.10/10 for the Single Player.The weapon system is awesome, choosing what upgrades to use, when you want to use them, switching between each weapon flawlessly and quick feels so fluid.The monsters are designed beautifuly, including the bosses who are heaps better than what DOOM 3 had to offer, anytime I would see the \""Arch Vile\"" (Summoner) I would actually go into panic mode as it was the only monster that I had issues with. The enviroments are absolutely beautiful and detailed as hell. The music is badass and fantastic, the OST needs to be released, I would happily pay money for it.The action is actually extremely fast paced in SP and a blast. There wasn\'t a dull moment in DOOM that I could find. The optimization for this game too is amazing, only running a 950m and i7-4720HQ and can play this game flawlessly. 30 ish FPS on medium, and 45ish FPS on low. (Yes I know time for an upgrade but building a PC when the 1080 comes out.)I loved this game so much I bought it twice, once for PC and once for PS4.Multiplayer 7/10Don\'t get me wrong, I love the multiplayer, i\'ve had a blast with it. But I personally didn\'t think it lets itself up to be what it could have been. Loadouts, and game speed are the killer for me. Other than that, the multiplayer is great, tons of stuff to unlock, badass armour to equip, and running a match where you absolutely dominate just feels so great. The demon runes too are a blast to play as, as well. But all in all, besides Demon Runes, the multiplayer doesn\'t offer too much new ideas. Still fun though. (Biasm due to obsession with DOOM as a whole may be included in this multiplayer review.)SnapMaps 5/10 hopefully 9/10 in the coming months, and 7/10 if you don\'t know how to or never will mod.As of right now, Snapmaps is a boring, useless tool, and I don\'t see many great things come of it... yet...12 monster limit, bugs in the logic (weird bugs.), limited things about the way you can build maps, and the presets are boring as hell. Spent 2 full days making a map, and probably won\'t ever make a map again. If I only got the game on PS4, I probably would rate it higher as it is a wonderful map editor for console. But for PC, it is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. Doom needs true modding support, and there should be way less limitations on snapmap for PC. Plus no boss monsters on snapmap? Disappointing. Although ID/Bethesda plan to release a lot more content for snapmap, I don\'t see it ever becoming a replacement for modding support. However for people who can\'t or never will pick up modding it will be great for you. Also the menu\'s for navigating snapmap maps is a mess right now, with the same content appearing on the front page all the time.There is work that needs to be done for snapmaps at the moment. A lot of work.My 4th and final critisicm of the game is no modding support as said above. Hopefully someone can find a way to make modding possible, but as of right now I don\'t see that happening for a long time.As for DLC, if all they plan to release is multiplayer related DLC and snapmap related DLC, I think they are going in the wrong direction. The fans (from what i\'ve seen and including myself) want Singleplayer DLC. Other than that here\'s a recap.Singleplayer: 10/10Multiplayer: 7/10Snapmaps 5/10, 7/10, 9/10?The Singleplayer experience alone trumps the MP and snapmaps enough that I highly, highly recommend it to anyone who likes FPS games/ DOOM games/ or action games.PS. If you love Devil May Cry, or DMC, you will find this game right at home for you.",76561197960324928,http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197960324928

Never trade to real humans again. And then the community(Who doesn't love the community?) acts like this ""HATS HATS HATS OOOOOOH AN UNUSUAL"" for God's sake it's a hat that has a horribly rendered effect flying all around it and it is magically worth $80 dollars or the golden pan worth 5,000.

Aliens appear all over the place and it's up to the main character ( Gorden Freeman ) to get to the bottom of it, and if possible stop it.

View it more like an experiance, sure there is objectives you need to do, but that's not the point. It is an immersive experiance, it can only be enjoyed if you are getting into the game and focuses on whats going on in the game and feeling the same feelings the characters give out.I honestly got scared, Not the kind of horror game scared but a different kind. You will understand what I mean if you played the game, i don't want to spoil anything. The ending was fine, no big twist or some big event. It was interesting I felt dissapointed just like my character I was playing.

Dear Esther is one of the most unique and interesting gaming experiences of the past decade, and easily one of the most beautifully realised locations ever, made especially impressive by the fact that it was done on the now old, Source Engine. You don't play Dear Esther, so much as you experience it, you explore an island to the sound of a fanastic soundtrack, meanwhile a narrator slowly tells you a rather cryptic story laced with deeper meanings and metaphors surrounding a major event in his life.

Also with my experiences with other post apocalyptic games, I have noticed three main types, there is the American wasteland, aka Fallout, where mutated beasts and creatures roam, and humans don power armour to survive, there is the Russian Metro, where even more mutuated beasts and even next level human evolution is taking place, then there is Australia, the Land Down Under. In Australia's wasteland, mutated beasts are not the focus, no. Cars, Oil and Guzzolene are the focus. Everyone becomes are souped up, heavy metal enthusiast rev-head. The need to travel extremely fast in a poorly constucted metal death machine that belches black oily smoke and sets fire the dusty ground beneath it's spiked wheels is everyone's dream.

Alan Wake travels from place to place: a barren wasteland, to an observatory, and a drive-in theatre, in an attempt to restore light and stop the darkness so he can confront Mr. Scratch and defeat him.Overall the game is an expansion on that of its predecessor, adding on a variety of weapons that are unlockable by collecting manuscripts, which encourages exploration of the entire map.

I spent nearly all of my hours on Skyrim on that one charecter I first made and started him off as the iconic sword and shield wielding dragon slayer that we all got boners over in the trailer and maxed that out and then switched to a duel-wielding berserker that tore apart my foes in a flurry of blade slashes and then decided to max out my sneaking skills when joining the dark brotherhood and thieves guild and transformed that into a sneaky bow and dagger wielding charecter that took out â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ly Thalmor and unsuspecting adventurers before they could even see me and finally turned my charecter into a duel magic wielding powerful arch-mage that had mastered both the destructive and healing powers that magic had to offer and ran around the world spamming the powerful master spell: Lightning storm, which when combined with my high level enchanting skills to make destruction spells cost 0 mana could take down any foe in just a few seconds of aiming and blasting away.Anyway you get the picture, I ended up spending a good 500 hours on that one charecter back when I played on my PS3 and then later moved onto PC and made Skyrim one of my first buys. I remember being so depressed when x-box users got the Dragonborn DLC a few months earlier then the other two platforms and couldn't think about the idea of not playing Dragonborn at the same time as other people but it eventually came out and I was almost as excited and filled with joy to play it as I was at the original release of Skyrim. My 100 hours of gameplay on Steam was with the DLCs alone without doing any of the side quests or guild missions that the game had to offer and I plan on going back to the world of Skyrim and doing it all again eventaully as this is and possibly always will be the greatest RPG ever made.As for a rating? Well i'd be delusional if I gave it anything less then a 10/10 and with the base game being so incredible alone as well three awesome expansions being added and the edition of the greatest mods and modding community that gaming has ever seen, I have no hesitation in giving this game an 11/10!I can't bare to wait another 4 years for The Elder Scrolls 6 and have no doubt that it will be able to surpass it's legendary predecessors and become another shining gem of gaming and be talked about for years just like it's past brothers Skyrim, Oblivion and Morrowind.",teh_pwnerer_7,http://steamcommunity.com/id/teh_pwnerer_7

16440,,No ratings yet,218230,,Posted July 30.,"So I've been putting off doing a review of Planetside 2 for a while now, but with the population dwindling despite the new dev team's stalwart determination to keep the game alive, I feel like now is the time. It is also the best time to play the game - the balance is the best it's ever been, and the content updates are more frequent than ever.Don't be fooled though, the game is dying, so if you want to play it and still get the proper full scale experience, you should really think about doing that now. All that aside, the gunplay is solid, the customisation is good, the microtransactions don't lend to a P2W environment, subscriptions are definitely worth it, the maps are huge and the battles epic. The netcode can take a little while to get accustomed to. It's not that it's bad though, just that concessions had to be made due to the scale of the game. For what it is, the lag is generally quite minimal. The only caveat is the minimum system requirements - though I'd wager anyone who has built a gaming PC after 2014 should be able to run the game with some degree of success - and if the in game settings fail you, there are a heap of great .ini tweaking guides to help you squeeze every last drop of performance from you rig.TL;DR - It's â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing fantastic, play it now, before it's gone.",76561198054613028,http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198054613028

Half an hour into the game i knew that was the wrong attitude. This game is awesome, it is sad, it is funny. It is a puzzle/RPG styled game, you spend alot of the game walking around, and collecting stuff and solving the puzzle.You are two doctors, who are going into the head of an old man named Johnny, to try and find his memories. You really have to read the dialogue the get the full effect. It is really sad once you get to the end, sad in a good happy way though. There are funny instances like a haduken thing. There is also a pretend pokemon battle where you attack a squirel, but then the child stops you.This is an awesome game, has a great story. The only thing i could fault it on is that it is a small game, but i would prefer quality over quantity any day, this is one of my favourite games of all time.

19005,,No ratings yet,251060,,Posted January 16.,"Overall this game is a positive. New units, factions and deck types really broaden the playable field. New maps seem to be ok too.My 2 biggest issues however is, A. The campaign where it normally involved only a handful of maps where the AI repeatedly attacks (often pointlessly, with me losing no units) and constantly getting new forces whilst mine canot retreat and refit in time. B. Naval battles are pointlessly imbalanced in favour of PACT with all but the Kongo and OHP class Blufor ships seemingly unable to either hit with or defend against missiles. Meanwhile the Redfor (PACT for me) support ships are numerous, cheap and effective. Whenever a naval battle comes up, my only chance is to kite around whilse launching massive numbers of bombers at the enemy capitals in the hope that one or two will get through.Overall i love the new setup, smoke is amazing and the reverse function is a lifesaver and if i could figure out how to win more consistently multiplayer would be great. But dont buy it for the sole purpose of naval combat and campaign unless you really have time to burn and happen to love the same maps over and over and over and over.....",Stryker103,http://steamcommunity.com/id/Stryker103

(one click button attack, hold to do power attack) There is a fair few weapons to come across from the mighty code hammer to the speedy coffee mug. There's also some pretty cool easter eggs from some of my favorite movies and games that i won't spoil.There is a really decent amount of different monsters to encounter too, from bats, annoying as hell goblins and slimes to minotaurs, cyclopes, Succubs and the crazy OP lich king. The randomization of this game is really well done too, it actually feels like luck based randomization unlike other rouge-likes/lites which you are more or less guaranteed to get better loot straight after spawn. On one playthrough I walked out of the bar/pub onto the first floor and got destroyed straight away by a cyclops, then on another run I found the code hammer on floor 3 and got to level 19.Plus the lighting, colors, interesting pixel art is like the cherry on top for me.",FuzzSlam,http://steamcommunity.com/id/FuzzSlam

With Skyrim, the stories that come from how the game works are often the best ones.It's a frozen nation, just to the north of where the previous game, Oblivion, took place. A briefly introduction sets up the plot: Skyrim is in the middle of a revolt, you've been sentenced to death, and dragons have just shown up. Good luck!At that point, you emerge from a cave into 40 square kilometres of cold and mountainous country, and that's it. Everything else is up to you.Not all of the landscape is subzero, and even among the frosty climes there's an exciting variety: ice caverns that tinkle with dripping frost crystals, hulking mountains with curls of snow whipped up by the howling wind, coniferous forests in rocky river valleys.The mountains change everything. Wherever you decide to head, your journey is split between scrambling up treacherous rocks and skidding down heart-stopping slopes. The landscape is a challenge, and travel becomes a game.It's hard to walk for a minute in any direction without encountering an intriguing cave, a lonely shack, some strange stones, a wandering traveller, a haunted fort. These were sparse and quickly repetitive in Oblivion, but they're neither in Skyrim: it's teeming with fascinating places, all distinct.These places are the meat of Skyrim, and they're what makes it feel exciting to explore. You creep through them with your heart in your mouth, your only soundtrack the dull groan of the wind outside, to discover old legends, dead heroes, weird artefacts, dark gods, forgotten depths, underground waterfalls, lost ships, hideous insects and vicious traps. It's the best Indiana Jones game ever made.The dragons don't show up until you do the first few steps of the game's main quest, so it's up to you whether you want them terrorising the world as you wander around. A world where you can crest a mountain to find a 40-foot flying lizard spitting jets of ice at the village below is a much more interesting one to be in. But fighting them never changes much: you can just ignore them until they land, then shoot them from a distance when they do.Your first dragon kill is a profound, weird moment. I rushed to the crashed carcass to loot it, then looked up. The whole town had come out to stand around and stare at the body, a thing as vast and alien to them as a T-rex in a museum.There is also a level up system. When that happens, you get a perk point: something you can spend on a powerful improvement to a skill you particularly like. Every hour, you're making a major decision about your character's abilities.They're dramatic. The first point you put into Destruction magic lets you stream jets of flame from your hands for twice as long as before. As you continue to invest in one skill, you can get more interesting tweaks: I now have an Archery perk that slows down time when I aim my bow, and one for the Sneak skill that lets me do a stealthy forward roll.Again, the freedom is dizzying: every one of 18 skills has a tree of around 15 perks, and the range of heroes you could build is vast. I focused on Sneak to the point of absurdity - now I'm almost invisible, and I get a 3,000% damage bonus for backstabs with daggers. It's the play style I've always wanted in an RPG, but I've never been able to achieve it before. The enemies you encounter are, in some cases, generated by the game to match the level of your character. In Oblivion that sometimes felt like treading water: progress was just a stat increase, and your enemies kept pace. That doesn't apply now that your character is defined more by his or her perks, because the way you play is always changing.Levelled content is also just used less: at level 30, my most common enemies are still bandits with low-level weapons. And I still run into things too dangerous for me to tackle.Taking a narrow mountain path to a quest, something stops me in my tracks: a dragon roar. I check the skies - nothing, but I hear it again three more times before the peak.At the top I find a camp full of bodies, with a large black bear roaring over them. Hah. He's still more than I can handle in straight combat, but as he reaches me I use a Dragon Shout. It befriends any animal instantly, and he saunters casually away. Feeling slightly guilty, I stab him in the back before it wears off.Which is when the dragon lands, with an almighty crash, six feet from my face. I RUN!One tweak is a huge loss, though: you can't design your own spells. Oblivion's spellmaking opened up so many clever possibilities - now you're mostly restricted to what you can buy in shops.While we're on the negatives, physical combat hasn't improved much. There are cinematic kill moves when your enemy is low on health, but whether they trigger seems to be either random or dependent on whether the pre-canned animation fits into the space you're in. Too much of the time, you wave your weapon around and enemies barely react to the hits.The exception is archery: bows are now deliciously powerful, and stealth shots can skewer people in one supremely satisfying thwunk.What does improve the general combat is a feature I didn't quite expect: you can hire or befriend permanent companions. I did a minor favour for an elf at the start of the game that earned me his loyalty for the next 40 hours of play. Sidekicks add a wild side to fights: an arrow from nowhere can end a climactic battle, or a misplaced Dragon Shout can accidentally knock your friend into an abyss.The Dragon Shouts, gained by exploration and killing dragons, are like a manlier version of conventional magic. One can send even a Giant flying, one lets you breathe fire, another makes you completely invincible for a few seconds. Even the one for befriending furry animals is macho: it can turn four bears and a wolf pack into obedient pets with one angry roar. The main quests themselves are mostly good: a happy mix of secrecy, adventure, and exploring incredible new places. One location, which I won't spoil, got an actual gasp. But then there's an abysmal stealth mission that seems to work on a logic entirely its own: guards spot you from miles away, despite facing the wrong direction. And the boss dragons it keeps throwing at you never get any more interesting to fight - adding more hitpoints just makes the repetition even harder to ignore.Everywhere else, the quests are magnificent. Chance encounters lead to sprawling epics that take you to breathtaking locations, uncover old secrets, and pull interesting twists. Even the faction quests are better here. It feels like Bethesda realised these became the main quest for many players, and built on that for Skyrim. They start small, but each one unravels into a larger story with higher stakes. Some of them feel like the personal epic that the main quest has always failed to be. These aren't engine issues, though. Skyrim is based on tech Bethesda built specially for it, rather than the middleware engine used by Oblivion and Fallout 3. It's a lean, swift, beautiful thing. New lighting techniques and a fluffy sort of frozen fog give the world a cold sparkle, and the previously puffy faces are sharp, mean and defined. Even load times are excitingly quick. On maximum settings, it runs at 30-40 frames per second on a PC that runs Oblivion at 50-60 - a decent trade off for the increase in scenery porn.The games we normally call open worlds - the locked off cities and level-restricted grinding grounds - don't compare to this. While everyone else is faffing around with how to control and restrict the player, Bethesda just put a country in a box. It's the best open world game I've ever played, the most liberating RPG I've ever played, and one of my favourite places in this or any other world.In case I'm not getting it across, this is a thumbs-up.",76561198092310770,http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198092310770

Tiers aren't a thing anymore, but for all effective purposes, the game still handles well in that regard*I totally reccommend this game to anyone and everyone.Generic statement aside, the concept of building and fighting your own personalised robots is not only an amazing idea, but Freejam executed it in a very nice way. You build with the base armor blocks a frame for your robot, and then deck it out with weapons, movement, electroplate (shields) and various other tech. The variety of different things you can build is endless, even now with the game still in development, and there exists a Tier system that sorts robots based on their 'rank' (higher level blocks add more rank) so that, as a newbie you're not getting thrashed by the elites running around with Tier 10 death machines.To me, the only downside is that Robocraft is a little pay-to-win. You can buy GC with real money, which you can use to buy parts at huge discounts, or to get premium, which boosts the amount of Tech Points and Robo Points you earn from battles. It's really, really enticing. Trust me, I have a bunch of Premium. However, this problem gets solved pretty nicely by the Tier system. All you do with premium is advance Tiers more quickly; the way the game is designed prevents premiums from being able to completely destroy non-premiums. So, aside from a little jealousy from the guys you leave behind in the lower Tiers, it really doesn't affect gameplay in any way.ADDITION - 29/10/2015So the first parts of my review are a year old now. Robocraft has seen a LOT of internal changes in that time. That sums up what Robocraft was and still is - an early access game. As a result, I've gone between playing and not playing over the course of the past year, as new changes turn me away from the game but I inevitably come back and learn to love them. Every new update, there are hordes of angry players - 'RIP Robocraft, wtf you doing Freejam I'm never playing this again'. And if you play too, you'll likely feel this way for a few days, but then after that it doesn't really matter. The game is still fun at its core and that's what matters.Overall, I give Robocraft a 9/10",76561198059301330,http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198059301330

It's very much a bland and by-the-numbers effort of shoehorning the Dead Island series into the inanely grindy free-to-play model that most people are getting sick of these days.The theme is so utterly detached from the mechanics that the game could be about anything.  You do repetitive missions to slowly grind resources and XP so you can build better equipment to keep grinding resources and XP at a higher difficulty.  To emphasise how detached the game's mechanics are from the franchise and theme:The missions see you fighting your way through interesting looking locales littered with all sorts of weapons and items that could be used as such... which are all entirely uninteractive.  As is everything else in the environment other than the zombies.Instead, you do some arbitrary task to gather resource cubes which you return to the start of the level, and after the mission you are rewarded with crafting materials such as duct tape and clothto use for blueprints.You can tell how little thought or imagination has gone into a game when you are forced to walk past assault rifles and rocket launchers to pick up cubes, so that you can craft a plank with nails in it out of duct tape and cloth.  I wish I was exagerrating, but that is literally what you do.There's a ""crossroads"" mission system for PvE where you get 3 randomly selected tasks each time, but within about 3 of these missions you've seen pretty much all there is to see.  None of it is particularly interesting - Go there.  Kill that.  Go there.  Defend that.  Go there.  Pick stuff up.The combat / gameplay itself is... passable.  Nothing particularly interesting or imaginative, and if you're playing with high ping due to not being in NA or EU it feels very slow and unresponsive.There doesn't really seem to be any endgame, or even any meaningful progression - just another grinding treadmill.  A game full of arbitrary limitations and restraints designed to find the lucritive balance between addicting you enough to keep playing and irritating you enough to cough up some dollars.Dull, uninspired, entirely devoid of any originality or charm.",phd_greg,http://steamcommunity.com/id/phd_greg

Although i expected to see alot for live troopers(like thousand) it's still amazing even after a decade since i played it on the original xbox it's still amazing. It makes me feel just like a clonetrooper. Although i have 10 hrs of gameplay i felt it was a little short. I really wish they will make a sequel or even a DLC to make the campaign longer its amazing i cant emphasis it more. 11/10 greatest FPS for me. To me, the graphics is 100/10 and so is the sound. its like u are there with Delta Squad.

Not for the faint hearted or those who give up easily, but those who like to smack giant demons around with weapons larger than your character and triumph over seemingly impossible odds. No other game cries out manmode like this one. This game cries out versatility in almost every aspect be it customizing your character, fighting style, appearance and even how you wish to play the game and progress. There are nearly no boundaries to stop you, only your skill and knowledge. Not to mention a fun pvp system that could be highly improved. 9.5/10 for offline play, a little less speculation of the story would be nice and a bit more concrete lore. 8/10 for pvp play. The online needs much more regulation to stop all the cheating. Otherwise, I would probably give it a 10.

48549,,No ratings yet,244850,,"Posted November 19, 2014.","First I'll list my problems with this game:- Theres no ingame tutorial. I didn't know what to do with myself when I first played this. It should be explaining as you go what to do and how to do it. Instead it gives you the option to pause the game and watch some 20 minute videos on the Steam forums. That is so stupid. Just explain to me what to do when I'm playing the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ thing.- There is really nothing to do. You can build massive ships and some pretty cool stuff but what after that? Just fly around aimlessly. - The controls are so bad it isnt funny. You press T to interact with objects, to press buttons, get in ships etc, why?T is all the over the other side of the keyboard why would they make one of the most used actions in the game in such an awkward spot. There is 2 jump buttons for some reason, space and F. Why did F have to be a jump button? Why not get rid of that stupid T and replace it with F, and just leave space to jump?And guess what, you can't change the controls.- When flying ships, up is up and down is down. This takes a while to get used to, especially when you've played alot of other flight simulators, where up is down and down is up. To make it even worse, theres no invert look option solely for ships. You can either have it on or off, meaning looking will be inverted when you're on foot to.- Everything is so slippery. You have a jetpack, and its so awkward to manouver yourself. Moving forward makes you tip to the side and flip upside down, while the camera gets stuck and you cant see what youre doing!- The ships arent very clear on how to operate them / interact with them. You see a massive yellow circle sort of thing attached to the bottom of it, so it only makes sense to try and enter the ship that way. No, you have to go over to the dull grey cockpit with no obvious markings to show you enter there.And that concludes my review. Its boring, no tutorial and the most pathetic controls I've ever seen.",76561198049927042,http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198049927042

After awhile, it will get boring...IF you dont understand the crafting system. What kept me addicted and playing is the fact that after every boss fight, I find a new spell (sigil). Since I failed to find information about the other spells on the internet, (no one posted anything...weird) I was excited and tempted to find out what exciting spell i will get next. One complaint i have is that some bosses are too cheap. They can 2 hit you or something.7/10P.S- â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ Delirium (no idea how it works, pretty much useless)",76561198008068264,http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198008068264

24507,,No ratings yet,35450,,Posted July 5.,"I have roughly 300 + hours in Company of Heroes 2, its not the longest time but I've been around for most of the games life dropping in after every update. I personally loved the allies in WW 2 specifically the Airborne divisions (obviously) but I always found interest in the battles between Germany and Russia, the Germans in CoH2 especially in mp were extremely powerful. When the OKW and USF were added to the game I was delighted that USF had been put in. Though after using them I realized who I was up against... The unstoppable power of the German army then when kitted out with fully auto MP40s and StG 44s along with the dreaded MG42 made it a living nightmare to play as either Russia or America in its unpatched state. I stopped playing after a while it was so bad, luckily you can get the relative same experience from Red Orchestra 2 but in a first person more team based view. Though I find it much more enjoyable to play as 1 man run into mg fire get cut down and try again, rather then see 3 entire sqauds run into mg fire get instantly pinned and completely annihilated by German autogun fire. I like this game and I still love CoH2 pro choice buy for sure!!!Also the Pacific stuff is cool I guess next stop Vietnam!!",76561198023478539,http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198023478539

I've been playing Space Engineers (made by the same people) and it has plenty of things to do and see, while, for the similar price of $20, Medieval Engineers just doesn't quite have enough to warrant the price tag.Yes I know it is Early Access, and the base building is absolutely awesome, but I found myself playing for about 20 minutes and then getting bored.

Transistor is no dissapointment, this game is huge step up from Bastion, showcasing unique gameplay mechanics, with a fully customizable weapon at hand. Though this is one of the biggest feautres of the game, the story, soundtrack, design and love for the characters in the game got me through to the end. This game has such a deep story of lost love and the struggles to reunite with that one. Not only is the soundtrack well written and fitting with the game, it flows with the story development and events that occur through your playthrough, the stylised art is painstakingly detailed, and geometrically themed to maintain the futuristic feel in cloud bank.Though there were few flaws, some people may find the combat mechanic a bit repetitive, though that is merely encouragement to mix the Transistor's abilities around for a different approach during conflict.The story is well written and heartfelt, while keeping soppiness out of the picture, beginning in the middle of initial conflict, which renders the protagonist unable to speak her mind and leaves the player to discover hidden details along the way, giving a satisfying and over all great ending. If I were to give this game a rating it would have to be 9/10 just because no game is perfect, but this cut so close, I love having a game the doesn't prolong important story development and yet still tells it powerfully, as well as the art and soundtrack winning me over, a truly moving game.9/10",Jazza1023,http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jazza1023

It's not just a repackaging with spangly new graphics - a lot of the game has been reworked so that it gives a great introduction to new players and returning CS veterans. Additional features include a training mission, customisable weapon loadouts (slightly reminiscent of Team Fortress 2), and the excellent Deathmatch gamemode that lets you play with any and all of the weapons as you run around the map and enjoy a neverending all-out guns-blazing brawl!CS:GO lets the Counter-Strike franchise live up to its name as the greatest competitive first-person-shooter with an all new freshness.

It tells a story of a squad of American soldiers fighting their way through Dubai to try and free the citizens from the evil John Konrad. The game portrays the effects that PTSD has on soldiers and how a simple rescue mission can turn into a mass graveyard.This game is not ""FUN"" it is a serious story-based game which would be best played over a weekend as it can be beaten in roughly 8-9 hours. Final thoughts:This game is amazing and you should buy it once on sale because it is a short story, but great none the less. Also do not read anything about it until you finish it because the game will be ruined as there are too many spoilers.Also the game mechanics are awful, so play it on normal difficulty because the gameplay isn't fantastic and you can easily get killed out of the blue by things.",36_T,http://steamcommunity.com/id/36_T

WowI will tell you what I like about the game.First thing thats very major to me... CHARACTER CREATION!!! ALL OF MY F%^KING YES!!!You can make your character either Good or Evil, look like you or total randomness, don't even get me started on the movement modes and powers, OH BOY!powers are what you are going to use as special abilities and your combat role, like if you choose Rage from the War of The Light DLC 1, you are going to have attacks that heal you, and have a Tank combat roleMovement modes are very little, there was only 3 before, but know there are 4, the 4 are...Flying: Makes you fly around the city of Gotham or Metropolis like Superman with ease, a bit slow at first, but getting super sonic makes it go MUCH quicker, GET THIS ONE!Acrobatics: Parkouring in a nutshell, choose this if your a Batman fan, but when you try to use it, enemies attack you and make you get out of movement modes, which is why I despise...SUPERSPEED: OMG THIS ONE SUCKS ANYTHING LONG AND HARD, THIS ONE MAY MAKE YOU GO SUPER FAST LIKE HELL, BUT THATS WHY IT SUCKS, SOMETIMES YOU CAN GO TROUGH THE SKYBOX BECAUSE OF IT, AND DO I NEED TO MENTION THAT YOU GET ATTACKED BY ENEMIES LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN, FOWARD AND BACK, MAKING YOU LOSE YOUR SPEED ALL THE F%^KING TIME!Skimming: Dunno, don't have it yet... it has to do with hovering though.... XPAnd back to customization, you can have mentors, the good mentors and what they do are...Batman: Has the most interesting storyline, and tech-like gear, but has the hardest difficulty.Superman: Very easy difficulty, but at the cost of least interesting storyline, also gear looks like bio engineered stuffWonderwoman: Oh boy, this one has a medium difficulty and a medium interesting meter to its story, also gear you it from this look like roman armor.Now for the villians.Joker: Batman's but evilLex Luthor: Superman's but evil, and I feel no one understands him.Circe: Again, copy and paste of Wonderwoman's BUT EVIL!Now, up to one of my only complaints...I FRIGGN WISH THAT HAL JORDAN AND SINESTRO WERE MENTORS, THAT WOULD INCREASE MY PLAYTIME BY OVER INFINITY, I F%^KING LOVE THE GREEN LANTERN COMICS TO DEATH, AND I DEMAND THEM TO BE MENTORS, MAKE IT HAPPEN SONY ONLINE ENTERTAINMENT, FOR ME AND MY FELLOW GREEN LANTERN FANS OUT THERE!!AND!If you chose good, a helper named ""Oracle"" helps you on your journey, but if you choose Evil...YOU GET MY FAVOURITE NPC IN THE GAME; CACULATOR!!! HE IS SO HILARIOUS YOU WILL LAUGH ALL OVER THE FLOOR AND HAVE TEARS OF JOY!Oh yea, forgot about the combat system... oops...Anyway, you choose your weapon in the  creation, and you click the left mouse button to do melee attacks, while right gives you ranged attacks, don't forget to use your super powers still...Oh, the story to, drat...The story is that Brainiac wants to conquer the multiverse, meaning he has to conquer Earth (Again Brainiac? Didn't I whoop you in Scribblenauts Unmasked when you tried doing that?) and he succeeded, UNTIL Lexy went back in time and warned the Justice League, and put Exobytes (The things that give you your powers) in the Atmosphere, giving people powers... Not going to spoil anymore, play it yourself and enjoy!And thats my review in a nutshell, hope you enjoyed my rant about superspeed, me ranting about how much I love the GL comics (IF YOU DON'T HAVE ONE GET ONE!) and Caculator being frickn hilarious, put your opinion of the review in the comments, I can deal with Positive and Negitive.",ILookedBehindTheTriclopsEye,http://steamcommunity.com/id/ILookedBehindTheTriclopsEye

Brilliantly executed, and endlessly fun, this game not only utilises the extensive Half-Life universe but expands on in as well.

You play as Gordon Freeman, a scientist with a shotgun and a gravity gun! The graphics aren't fantastic by today's standards but you can imagine how great they would have been upon the 2004 release. You get control of a diverse range of weapons and vehicles, facing countless different enemies, from zombies to trigger happy law enforcers. Set in a dystopian world, the game has huge variation in level design and crushing combine soldeirs with a huge metal crate lifted by a magnetised crane never gets old. One of the best things however, is the awesome physics engine this game has to offer. You can use your gravity gun to move objects around you, often rewarding you with the satisfaction of firing a metal disc to take a zombie's head off.

People who think poise was an OP feature for heavy builds, and then the people who thinks it's complete bs.Heavy armor's main advantage was Poise, allowing you to withstand hits without flinching, or slightly so untill you're staggered. Clerics, Sorcerers, Pyromancers and Warriors alike, were all hindered by this change to the 3rd installment.To this degree, you might as well as start off deprived and play through the entire game as is, or atleast use the Master's attire because armor reduction does jack all.I'm am gravely disappointed in Bandai Namco and From Software",Dante69123,http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dante69123

It was the perfect type of game for me. When it came out I did not enjoy it as much as i thought i would. Don't get me wrong, I REALLY like the game, but I just can't bring myself to love it, and that's because of one thing.Stranded deep is a very good early access game, it runs exetremely well, rarely crashes. It does have a substantial amount of bugs but most of these are just funny and do not take away from the game, and the bad ones are removed within one patch. The game looks amazing and is such a good idea, and now all the developers need to do is add more things to the game. As of now, the game is very simple. You go from island to island, explore wrecks, collect loot, build bases, deal with wildlife, deal with weather, collect food & water and survive. This is exactly what the description of the finished game should be (plus escape back home, or any other cool things the developers can think of), it just needs to be fleshed out. There needs to be more types of everyhting. More wrecks (maybe even caves or other natural exploration areas), more loot, better base building, more (and interesting) wildlife, and in my opinion the most important of all: more types of islands, besides the generic, tiny palm tree islands. I would love to see tiny sandbars, or a massive jungled island, or a grassy island, or a large desert island.Overall, I would reccomend you this game the way i would reccommend any good (emphasise good) early access game. If it looks interesting to and you want to get in on the developement or just join in as the game develops, I would highly reccommend it.",76561198042297860,http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198042297860

I had finished this game on my friend's Xbox 360 only months before and enjoyed playing it with him in Co-op mode. After finshing this game on my PC I realised how boring and repetitive the game really was. The game is not a free-roaming or exploring type. It restricts you to the very bone with it's story levels, which are the only things that you can actually do in this game. Sure, myself being a huge Tolkien fan should enjoy this game a lot, but the lore is barely touched on. There are refrencing to the movies and books but no huge give away of what the game/story is actually about to all new-comers. If your looking for a Middle-Earth game with heaps of lore and factual basings on Tolkien's work, please, please buy Shadow of Mordor. I did so on my Xbox One, and have to say, it's probably one of my favourite games of all time.",EliteStealth101,http://steamcommunity.com/id/EliteStealth101

People are fair in saying that this is not really a game, and more of an exploratory, audio visual experience, for lack of a shorter, better phrase. With Gone Home's main gameplay aspect being exploration, it makes it so enjoyable to walk around a house and look at things while slowly uncovering a deep story of how your sister slowly discovers who she really is. I usually wouldn't label anything as cute, but the ending definely deserves something of the sort.Other than that, the developers have done so well at creating an eerie atmosphere to keep you on the edge of your seat, in preparation for anything that may happen, with mention of ghosts and exorcisms, and the chilling, storm constantly raging outside, This game manages to be scary in a way, without having anything scary happen.This game is purely amazing, it has a great story, and a sweet soundtrack, plus with it being set 90s I got a huge feeling of early childhood sort of thing going on.

32787,,1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful,311340,,"Posted March 19, 2015.","What can I say about this game? It's masterfully ported, has fantastic graphics, almost seamless controls, tremendous atmosphere and plenty of replayability. The story, while intriguing, is admitedly rather short and won't be of any significance or interest to those who haven't played Metal Gear Solid 3 and/or Metal Gear Solid Peace Walker. Both of those games, while dated, are fantastic and well worth playing even today. Especially considering Metal Gear Solid 3 is considered one of the best games ever made.Back to Ground Zeroes, the gameplay is superb. Sneaking through enemy territory has never felt so simple yet effective. The controls, regardless of whether you are using K+M or a controller, are spot on. The quality of this port in general really is a testament to Hideo Kojima's dedication to the world of gaming. Especially when mainstream games like Far Cry 4 and Assassin's Creed Unity are casually thrown onto PC with little-to-no optimisation before release.As far as I can tell, all the returning characters from Peace Walker are still voiced by the original actors (aside from Naked Snake/Big Boss, who is now voiced by Kiefer Sutherland rather than David Hayter). Naturally, they all do a very good job bringing their roles to life. A common complaint about the game is the recasting of Big Boss. David Hayter's voice has become an icon of the series and many felt that his replacement was detrimental. I am a Metal Gear fan as well so I may be biased in my opinion of who is better. Personally, while David hayter is undeniabley the voice of Solid Snake, I feel that Kiefer Sutherland does a fantastic job as Naked Snake/Big Boss (For the uninitiated: Solid Snake and Naked Snake are two different dudes, they just look identical for reasons you will learn if you play the first Metal Gear Solid (wink-wink nudge-nudge)) and I wouldn't have it any other way. In in all: This is an amazing game for those familiar with Metal Gear. For the uninitiated however, I strongly advise that you play MGS 1, 2, 3 and Peace Walker (maybe even Portable Ops if you like, although it's not at all necessary) before you think about trying this one.Also, you'll definitely want to play this before The Phantom PainVerdict:For the Metal Gear fan: 9/10For the newbie: 7/10",phyland,http://steamcommunity.com/id/phyland

The Political aspects were very Intense in how they were carried out. The thought of this being a valid possibilty has struck me more than once during my run through it. Yet i enjoyed the Story itself, despite what has happened.Regarding the two Characters you see throughout the story, they are too Life-like to be regarded as just AI (One having more reason to be more so than another). From the Refined and Pleasent Persona of *Hyun-ae, To the Feisty but yet Proud *Mute, these two ""AI"" are two girls that are able to relate to a wide Audience for many different reasons.I could talk alot more about this game, from the Intense Curveball that is thrown at you, to being forced to pick between two sides.All in all, This VN Deserves more Attention than it gets in my Opinion.Would i recommend it?Y.E.SFinal Score 9.8/10",Fox_Hanyou_Mikoto,http://steamcommunity.com/id/Fox_Hanyou_Mikoto

The game is fair on all player skill levels; you'll find many servers with a level cap, ensuring that everybody gets a fair chance. There are micro-transactions in place, but there is no emphasis on using the system, as all items that can be purchases using real cash, may also be purchased using in-game credits. What's more is that these credits are earned very quickly, and there are often events such as double xp and random loot drops, which ensure that evey player gets the same opportunity to see what these top-tier items are like. Yes, I am aware that at the time of this review being written, my playtime hours are rather low, but that is mainly due to the fact that I am playing on old system, while making do with a sub-par internet connection.

This will not replace your desktop, no matter how much you try.It is just too inneficent to replace a wall with icons to double click and open up nearly anything with a 3D enviroment that will take time walking inbetween shortcuts. The only scenario where i think AA will be faster, is in the case of a webcomic, where instead of going to a website, click on the icon, wait a second, and it opens up on your 3D desktopYou are playing this game, because you want points for style. And my, is there much style to be had here, even with the basic game. One example i can give is if you find a good enough map, you can make rooms for different items. Remember, this game can be mounted onto other source games, meaning you can use those maps. A good thing to do would be to go into the Gmod workshop, and find a good map, mount Gmod onto AA and build a map from that. Whilst you are on the workshop, look also for ragdolls, models, and other objects you would want to put onto your map. My map has tanks from warhammer 40K, Legendary Pokemon, an artificial forest, all on a star destroyer. All with all my games, creative software, movies, music ect. neatly catergorised and placed onto the map, from which i can see all visually, rather than having to explore a music library, or look down a list of my steam games, (of which i have hoarded over 100 now). I even have a room dedicated to comics that i had bought on comixology, and I can read them, straight from that room.Anarchy Arcade like many have said, can be considered a Mancave simulator. I have to agree to an extent. Consider the possibilites of what you can do to this mancave. Do you want a simple appartment? With ""quick and easy"" access to your items, or do you want to go all out? Put your cave on the moon, on one of those TF2 trade servers (I am working on rebuilding my cave in MinecraftRealmsV2 at time of writing, and will probably post to the workshop when i am finished working on it), on a star destroyer, or even if you really wanted to, create your own map, and share it to the workshop. The source engine allows for that, and its a matter of your skills as to whether or not you want to do that. Do you want your mancave to be simple videos, posters, music, or do you want Guards, Tanks, a sphinx, or my personal favourite, A scarab from the Halo franchice. TLDR: This is for those who do not care for efficency, and can only be considered more useful when you have too much stuff on your desktop, where it becomes near impossible to read. Otherwise, you can create the coolest desktop/mancave. The source engine allows for that.",SpiritOfDeath2,http://steamcommunity.com/id/SpiritOfDeath2
6387,,3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful,393380,Last edited August 22.,Posted July 2.,"For those not familiar with what Squad is, it's essentially the new version of Project Reality, which was a BF2 mod back in the day and is now a stand alone title that focuses on realism, patience and teamwork. However the game is quite dated now and has needed a serious upgrade like this for a while.Squad is currently in its Alpha and while it looks much better than PR, it's stripped of a lot of the features that make PR so great, but rest assured these will be coming in the future, i.e vehicles. Even in Alpha, the game is WELL worth the price, you're not going to find a more realistic, team based modern shooter/simulator outside of Arma; but in many ways this is much more accessible than Arma, as you don't need a clan or a good sized party to enjoy the full experience. If you have yourself a good team, who work together and know what they're doing, then you're going to have a lot of fun with the game, however, there are a lot of new players right now who don't know how to play the roles, so some games can get frustrating. (Most players here, as in Project Reality use mics and you're not really going to get by without one, so I recommend you have one before purchase.)DISCLAIMER, this game requires teamwork, communication and patience, you might go an hour without getting a single kill and that's fine, this isn't Battlefield, do not purchase this if you're not familiar with the likes of Arma, Project Reality or Red Orchestra OR if you're not willing to learn. The maps are huge with thousands of possibilities and choices when it comes to strategy and tactics,  the weapons are accurate, sound effects are almost too real, teams work together and you can see some amazing things in this game with a little initiative from squads. the community is friendly, supportive and willing to help always. This is only Alpha and there's so much more to come.

From walking into a bank with an AK-47 and shooting up the place and running out with money, to sneakily breaking into a Military Mercenarie group compound and sneakily stealing guns, Money, Bombs, servers, Paintings, Gold, and Drugs. to cooking meth in a run down crack house, hell you can even have a nightmare about cops raiding your safe house, you can even cook meth in your dream (Don't get bit by the spider though :P), personally I would reccomend waiting for Payday 2 to go on sale though, You can pick it up and all the DLC for like CDN 35$.Gameplay 8.4/10Variation 9.5/10DLC 5.0/10Fun 9.4/10All in all 7.8/10TL;DR It's a fun game, decent ammount of stuff to do, Grab it on sale for 50-75% off.",Kootrasman,http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kootrasman

Unlike the ARMA 2 mod, this game will be specifically tailored to be a zombie game, instead of war with zombies thrown in. There are very few zombies and the people on it are murderous and unpredictable, but you will always get a story out of it to tell your friends. Survive how you want or build your community and strike the zombies before they strike you. There will be many improvements made and the game is far from finished but I believe that this will be the most emmersive Zombie-Survival game yet.",76561198035811518,http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198035811518

Whilst fun it was also a little boring, especially if you play it directly after playing Borderlands which is a better game.What was disappointing was the missing customisable weapons mechanic which was promised prior to release but never delivered (I suppose it will be an extra charge as DLC).Seeing as it only really a map and character addon to Borderland, it might have been better to be able to extend gameplay from Borderlands into Borderlands 2 but the way the converted Borderlands players to be NPCs in Borderlands 2 made that impossible.Overall not much different that Borderlands, simply not as good as they wanted to nickle and dime players with DLC that is obviously content missing from the game, if a lot of the DLC had been in the game rather than charged extra for, the game would be as good as the orginal but honestly if you have Borderlands dont bother with Borderlands 2 as it is not as good.

This game is free (although pay currency and premium accounts and vehicles are present), and does indeed look spectacular as a F2P, and generally delivers a fun experience in its existing state. However, as with most MMO's and F2P games, there is a grind for higher tier vehicles and upgrades, so this may turn away some players.Unfortunately, there are some inherent problems that currently exist that can marr the enjoyment for players and/or those who are particularly focused on the realistic and factual aspects of this game.Various problems include inconsistencies with damage dealt or taken, factual errors of stats/vehicle specifications, matchmaking issues (various tiers/battle rating of vehicles intermixing to large degrees), and vehicle performances. Some of this can be attributed to the fact it is a player driven game, and thus cannot be 100% historically accurate unless specific constraints are implemented through player organised events or game mechanics.Some of these problems were present fairly early and still exist, (The developers seem to have its attention focused in pushing new content which has pros and cons) though patches may generally solve some of the issues, you can expect unfair tiering at times.However, I generally look past most of the whole 'pay to win' parts or grinding and simply squad with friends or strangers to focus on playing the game and having fun. the game delivers on that regard and is relatively easy to slip into and start playing, thus I would recommend this game.",Z1_M4N,http://steamcommunity.com/id/Z1_M4N

This game is amazing especially if you're a south park fan. This game is a RPG styled game, kinda like Mario and Luigi back in time, you can pick a class to choose between: Fighter, Mage, Thief and Jew. For me personally i liked the Fighter the best, his skills were my favourites. This game is worth the money, although it is short if you rush it (Which i didn't) this game will be worth you're time.

I didn't have a real interest in learning to actually play the guitar (I've tried numerous times in the past and given up), all I wanted from this was something I could casually play, but with a bit more challenge/reward than the ""plastic guitar"" games.It started off exactly how I was expecting - just playing a single note every now and then, but as you improve and play the notes its' giving you well the game will adjust and add more into the mix. Before too long you'll be given chords, double-stops, legato techniques, and plenty of other new bits to play.The way the difficulty works is good, it won't give you something to play that's way over your head (too often), but keeps you improving at a good rate.In the few weeks I've been playing, I've progressed a lot further with my skills than I have in all my previous attemps to learn guitar without Rocksmith. I'm interested in learning to play again, and this makes it a great way to do it.Pros:* Very cost-effective way to learn (if you already own a guitar).* Being able to have your skills quantified (Mastery percentage, song accuracy, scores etc) and improving is great motivation to see your progress and keep playing.* Makes practicing fun!Cons:* Music choice is decent, but could do with a lot more songs. New songs are released every week though.* There's no option to see the music to play in Tab format.Overall, I highly recommend it, it's a lot of fun and you learn something while you play.",76561198059640748,http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198059640748

There are many hats and weapons for you to acquire (including Strange weapons and Killstreak Weapons).That was before the  Love and War Update. Now, in my opinion, I think that there are way too many taunts in this game. First, there were a few, and that didn't affect the game a lot, but now, in nearly every server, someone has to be doing the Conga taunt. I like the Conga taunt, but when you use it, most people will forget what the main purpose of this game is (kill). Nevertheless, I still love playing this game.

49236,,No ratings yet,212680,,"Posted December 1, 2013.","FTL is a strategy game set in space, and what a game it is. Before you begin, you get to choose either Easy or Normal difficulty. While these don't sound relatively menacing, in a regular game these equate to Extremely Hard and Impossible difficulties. During the game, you take on the role of a captain of a spaceship and will usually fail horribly at it. But sometimes you won't. Sometimes you will get to the Last Stand (with a great deal of hope and lots of preparation), telling yourself that you will win and everything will turn out fantastically. 2 minutes later, you will admit a soul-crushing defeat and begin crying on your bed. When you stop crying, you will play this game over and over again and you will love every minute of it, because this game is absolutely brilliant. So if you have a soul, and it is due for a bit of crushing, buy this game. If you don't have a soul, buy this game anyway. You will not regret it.",humanx25,http://steamcommunity.com/id/humanx25

Half the time I fast travelled or entered a building it would crash.I only played about 30 minutes of it before I gave up on it and uninstalled the expanion. Luckily my saved game was salvagable. My initial impressions were:* The UI in SoD is very dark and quite unpleasant. * The game felt very linear.* It did not feel like Baldurs Gate, it felt like a poorly made clone. * The story wasn't drawing me in at all. It felt corny and 'simple'. * The voice acting was very average. * The misc. quests were less than two minutes long.Not recommended.",76561197987394736,http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197987394736

The stealth system is superb, the combat system also superb and the powers are extremely useful, easy and comfortable to use and very nicely balanced.As the authors claimed, you have a LOT of options open to you in every mission (speedrunning through, killing everyone, or sneaking past every individual unnoticed without harming a fly). There are also a LOT of very intuitive ways to gain access to your targets and also to escape afterwards.To top it off, this game rewards exploring! You can find hidden shortcuts, or supplies, or also excellent upgrades for your arsenal or your powers, and considering the powers at your disposal, many of these are ingeniously hidden.The story is just beautiful (in both the good and evil endings). Characters are excellent too (despite looking kinda similar).

You also have a weight meter which can determine whether your loadout will make you run fast or slow, and how fast your stamina will run out.Now lets get into the combat:The combat is fast paced at times and slow paced at others, you will constantly find yourself having to visually inspect whether you have killed a person and wondering ""should i check or should i run past and hope the enemy is dead"". From the last sentence you probably can tell the game is going to be realistic. It is. If you move up on your own your playing a wild card, instead you might want to call out a couple of your teammates to help you complete/capture an objective (Yes, there are a lot of different gamemodes to choose from, most of which include control areas). There is virtually no HUD (Heads Up Display), the only things that do show up on the hud is how many magazines you have, and info about the objective(s). The gunplay is realistic, recoil is a thing and attachments can supress that recoil but also you can by swithing modes on your gun or burst firing. 1-2 bullets from most guns can take down an enemy.Lets talk graphics:The graphics in the game are not spectactular, but still enough to immerse you in the gameplay, though the design and textures on the weapons look great. You can't really expect a game run and made on the source engine  and is only slightly modified is going to get you amazing Battlefield graphics.Overall Gameplay:The gameplay is realistic, tense and rewarding if you play the game right, what a mordern military shooter should be, it offers great and realistic gunplay, a variety of gamemodes and maps. Insurgency will keep you coming back to play some more (also teamwork is a thing in this game).",76561198057389499,http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198057389499

Then for some reason I just stopped playing.Last night was my first play through since then and I was absolutely amazed by how things changed.I LOVE the inventory system, it's so simplistic and a lot easier to manageAnd the building system is another feature that has taken the simplistic road making it a lot less of a headache and a lot easier to build quickly under pressure of other players in the area.Also the maps a beautiful, filled with colour and sound, the only thing is (maybe it was just the server I was on) I struggled to find any deer or boars (but that's not a fault of the game and was just possibly the server I was on)I would definately re-recommend this to previous Rust enthusiasts, I'm glad after months of debating whether to get back into it or not that I did. So much work has been done (as opposed to other early access games I've been playing) and you can tell developers are moulding this into a top contender of the mulitplayer survival genre",76561198052193514,http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198052193514

After playing about 15 minutes of the first game I almost gave up on the series, but luckily I didn't and I am writing this review.I bought this game when it first came out and boy how it has changed since the first time I played it. The developers have really poured their hearts and souls into making the The Witcher 3. I am a little ashamed that I have played so little of it to be honest, but its hard finding enough time to truly enoy this game. It is not a game you can play for an hour or two every so often because there is so much going on with the story and if you stop playing for a bit you forget about what else happened (and there is a lot of stuff happening around you)You should really buy this game if you like RPG's, this is hands down the best one there is and it actually feels like you are immersed in the witcher universe.Words can't express how great this game is, just buy it, its well worth the money.",36_T,http://steamcommunity.com/id/36_T

The graphics are amazing, and if you have the equipment to have NVIDIA Flex turned on, then it is porbably the best gore-filled game available! If you're looking for a kill-fest, gore-flying-blood spattered slow motion flaying limbs and gibs then this is the game for you! With a growing diverse range of classes there's many different types of weapons to choose from. While each individual class itself is currently lacking a huge range within themselves, you at least have a variety of weapons across all classes. While the game can be somewhat repititve and a grind to level up your perks, it's definitely still a lot of fun and as aesthetic as a gor-fesat game can be! There's something beautifully satisfying about enterting slow-motion (ZED Time) and watching as you lower your Zweihander (2-Handed Long Sword for the Berserker Class) from above your head in a mighty Zed splitting motion and you split that gorefast in half, slice it's head open and watch all the blood and guts you could want fly out. The new in-game cosmetics are somewhat overpriced, and the range of weapons for each individual class need to be expanded, but overall a great game, lots of fun and stunning graphics! 9/10 for what you'd expect. Worth the $30 USD.",76561198003546877,http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198003546877

Variable camera angles and the ability to take command of your soldier individually or a vehicles and correct its aim for better accuracy in exchange for a loss of perspective on the larger scale battle. This is where Command and Conquer meets Commandos with a squirt of Company of Heroes. If you like games like ARMA 3 and Company of Heros this is the hybrid for you. It literally feels like you were to put Commandos' character contol into the engine of Company of Heroes within the evironment of the Arma 3 RHS mod. Some of the more intimate character commands are a but tricky and less responsive than to be desired but for it's current state ad an easrly access feature it has enough controlability and content, not to mention the already growing Workshot Content, to warrant several hours worth of addictive gameplay per session. As someone completely new to the franchise, this is a refreshing game with a unique mili-sim / sector control / conquest / survival cornerstone to its foundation. Worth the money to pay for it in its current state. As mentioned there are bugs and some frustrating mechanics for individual unit functions but we can only hope they will be smoothened out. == pro's & cons ==My biggest con about the game  is that this may not be for friends who live far apart to play together. When I was uploading to my youtube channel whilst playing this my entire lobby suffered lag that would cause the game to stop momentarily, quite often, when my ping surpassed 350ms. When not uploading and having enough free bandwidth to keep my ping below 80ms there were no issues. I havent tested any further ranges of ping between.My biggest pro woul dbe that to play this with your friends is one of the most interesting and engaging games to participate in as a team. Roles can be given or you can just play it your own way. Theres are so many playstyle possibilites for this. You can choose to just control a small group of specialists and leave the rest of the companies within your force to be managed by your team mates or you can choose to have a little bit of everything. Do you prefer to play the sniper elite or the vehicle company or do you want to play them all?I reccommend this game, for its target audience; which would be people who want a milisim / rts  or as close as they can get to it.",SucoVidya,http://steamcommunity.com/id/SucoVidya

This game is a must-buy!It may be only one story mission, but as a long-time Metal Gear Solid fan, there is so much nostalgia.There is easily over 10 hours of gameplay to be played. Also, the missions are extremely replayable, so you will find yourself wanting to play again and again, to find different ways of completing each mission.This is an amazing stealth game, taking the previous games and transforming it into the ultimate open-world game. There is no stealth gaming experiencebetter than this or so well optimised. The graphics are amazing (Althought there a certain features lacking eg ability to disable Depth of Field)The story is amazing, and packed with fan-service. It is a great way to finally see how Big Boss became the person he is.The sound, and quality of cutscenes is excellent.There is no dispute that Metal Gear Solid V is one of the greatest games ever created.For the cheap price tag and hours of gameplay to be played, this game is a must-buy.Once you've played this game, you will immediately add MGSV The Phantom Pain to the top of your must-buy list.",hippontherun,http://steamcommunity.com/id/hippontherun

My prefered race is of course le badass predator, you need to no how to use a predator if you dont your a sitting duck unless you use the predators brute strength 2 just punch your way out but you will land with some damage. Predator has much tools used for traps,hunting, AND MORE... the same for alien but this time you are left with 2 hands and a tail you might be saying ""Oi yeh â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥in â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ review a better game yeh c*** just 2 hands and a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥in tail WHAT CAN YOU DO WITH THEM THROWS UR HANDS IN THE AIR LIKE SOME DRUNK â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ GOING PAR-TAY"" well those 2 have many good features such as the hands allow you to climb up walls the tail knocks out the lights and has a powerful attack. those 2 races r gr8 but then again who could resist a person with a gun like srsly the human race may not be as strong or be very good with a tactic but its weapons leads you to victory im not going 2 do any more spoilers...This game is 10/10... for people who like stragedy,action,aliens,horror AND MORE... i may be doing more reviews in the future Lion out!!!",76561198053761623,http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198053761623

Not only is the driving disgusting, and delayed but the fact that I was half way through the game and also had collected alot of the game's collectibles and done alot of the side quests and then had all this go to â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ because of the game deciding to blue screen my entire computer and then corrupt my save file. If this wasn't bad enough, Ubisoft's pointless bloatware of a launcher which claims to 'synchronize my saves and achievements with the cloud' couldn't locate my save file.The rumors were also true, this game is optimised for Nvidia cards. I've got an AMD R9 270 which can play the game on ultra, although the FPS lag was horrible. I'd be shooting, driving, or even just strolling, and the game would just lock up my entire computer for about 2-5 seconds. You'd think that with an extra year to focus on this game they'd have looked at these bloody things.According to forums and Steam's own user-reviews, other's are also having both of these problems.On a lighter note, the game's actual core, stealth, and hacking mechanics are pretty nice.

Despite the shotty job that they did porting it over to PC, some simple to install mods make this game one of my best experiances on, any platform. The challenge it gives you, is the perfect thing for anyone who wants to test their ""skills"" as a gamer. The way the community has decided it works is, in my opinion, quite good. The higher your level, the worse you're doing, and having a higher level makes the game harder since the better players that you could summon for help have lower levels then you would think. This is a almost perfect game, if it didn't have the issue of people modding characters to be OP despite their level and eqiupment.

So what you do is find a vault, set up a drill, fix the drill, fix the drill again, fix the drill a couple more times, and then finally you ca- wait no the drill jammed again. Fix it again, and then you can take the money! But wait... there's a gate in front of you, and you have to drill through it! (You can also blow it up, but don't tell them, it ruins the fun) So you set up the drill again, fix it, fix it yet again, start getting annoyed, fix it again, and finally it's do- no wait it â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING JAMMED AGAIN. So you fix the piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ drill again, and FINALLY you get the money. But what are those boxes over there? You see a teammate open one of them, and get more money! So you try open some, see they take 20 seconds each, and get even more annoyed. So you stop at 5, and get absolutely nothing. Then you escape with the money and your teammate wants to open every single box, so about 15 minutes of opening boxes later, you get a decent amount of loot and a lot of time wasted. So you keep running all the loot over, get shot by a turret but still secure all except 2 bags. You and your teammate have very little health. You want to escape but he wants the bags, and won't escape unless he gets them. So you run over with him, get the bags, run back and you both get shot by the turret and you both go down.

Been a Wolfenstein fan from childhood.Machine Games has managed to mix modern shooter features with the old for a very convincing experience. Solid story line and character development, Wolfenstein NO brings the FPS genre backs to its roots with fast pace action based around combat intensity, excitement and less hyper realism that has overtaken the entire genre as of late. No more ducking for cover every five seconds to regenerate your health. Wolfenstein NO makes good use of HP and Armour pick ups that allows the player to feel more apart of the story rather than just a bystander.I can't rave enough about the gun play in this game, amazing gun selection and design, almost every weapon can be dual-wielded. A good variety of weapons that all have different uses which help foster and encourage different play styles eg. stealth or open combat. This game has put to rest the argument that every FPS must embrace a multiplayer feature. While I hope due to the success of Wolfenstein NO a standalone multiplayer is developed in the future that echos the Enemy Territory model of earlier Wolfenstein games, this game easily stands tall on its singleplayer features alone.With multiple difficulties, different characters and a meaningful collectibles feature that unlocks four very unique gameplay modes, this game has plenty of replay-ability and could easily be enjoyed for many playthroughs. I don't normally like DLC but I really hope this game gets some side mission or extended story line DLC and fingers crossed a sequel in the coming year or two.Hats off to Machine Games for crafting an enjoyable singleplayer FPS in an era where everyone is obsessed with multiplayer and for standing by their development goals till completion to produce a solid product. Props also to Bethesda for backing a  studio with great talent and vision. Hope you enjoy this game as much as I did.",jjas01,http://steamcommunity.com/id/jjas01

Os humanos venceram a guerra e prenderam os monstros debaixo de uma montanha, em um lugar chamado Underground/Underworld. No jogo vocÃª Ã© uma crianÃ§a que cai nesse ""buraco"" e tenta voltar pra casa. VocÃª pode escolher jogar de 2 maneiras (principais) Genocide: faÃ§a como qualquer outro jogo e mate tudo e todos.  Pacifist/true pacifist: poupe a vida de seus ""inimigos"" durante o jogo,  voce vai conhecer muitos personagens, independente da rota. Toriel: guardiÃ£ das ruÃ­nas que passa uma figura maternal no inÃ­cio do jogo. Sans: o esqueleto gente boa. Sans usa a fonte comic sans nos diÃ¡logos (Ã© genial)   caso vocÃª faÃ§a a genocide, terÃ¡ que lutar contra ele (e ser estuprado/a) Papyrus: irmÃ£o do Sans e tenta com todas as suas forÃ§as entrar para a Guarda real.Alphys:A cientista real.Undyne: A lÃ­der da guarda real e professora de culinÃ¡ria nas horas vagas. Ã© conhecida por nunca desistir de nada.Mettaton: CriaÃ§Ã£o de Alphys e protagonista de  uma sÃ©rie de tv.Asgore: o Grande rei.  que tem planos de abrir a barreira para a superfÃ­cie. Jerry: um babaca.  sÃ©rio, ninguÃ©m no jogo gosta dele. Deixando isso de lado, aqui vai minha nota final.  LEMBRANDO, OPINIÃƒO PESSOAL HistÃ³ria;  9/10 depois de se aprofundar um pouco, chega a ser emocionante.MÃºsicas: 10/10.GrÃ¡ficos: 8/10 nada impressionante, Mas em vÃ¡rios momentos Ã© lindo. Dificuldade: 7/10. Tem os chefes ridÃ­culamente fÃ¡ceis e os que parecem que vieram direto do fundo do inferno para te matar.Jogabilidade: 10/10 uma jogabilidade Ãºnica, onde vocÃª deve escolher entre matar ou salvar monstros.

However, despite the sheer awesomeness of this game there are a few problems which i will address : -playerbase/multiplayer wait timeThe amount of time untill i find one player is beyond insane. Prior to buying lethal league i looked at the amount of players present and to my suprise i saw 600-700 people, i thought well, since this is primarily aimed towards multiplayer, the amount of players should fine. A few minutes later i reassured myself and bought it. After the totorial of lethal league i did not waste any time, i decided to play my first lethal league multiplayer match.........It took ages, but then a guy named Squaresx5 saved me from my misery, i pounced in joy breaking my chair in the process. I was so happy, even though i was a noob and knowing that i will slaughtered. -Replay valueI know the time i accumulated is trivial which results in my review being little to no significance, but from first sight, the HUD, the menu and so on i seem to be getting the same message all around the place. CONTENT? REPLAYIBILTY?  but dont get me wrong, it is immensely fun and a good time waster here and then, after awhile though... it kinda loses the appeal, hence people leave. This problem will ultimately affect the player base and the overall longevity of the game.Stuff to consider adding in the future:+stats+stuff to buy and enhance. new abilities?, potions?, weapons?.+faster multiplayer connection+new maps and new characters+new modes+and events+leaderboard?Personal ratingAudio: 9/10Gameplay:8/10Creativity 10/10Graphics 8.5/10Overall a solid  8.875/10 The review written was not to stop you from buying this game but only to inform you of the amount of improvement needed.

Quite possibly.Darkest Dungeon is a game I only recently discovered, and I'm very glad I did.An incredibly punishing game that should please masochists the world over - Darkest Dungeon combines a variety of gameplay elements spanning several genres, and heavy influence from Lovecraftian mythos with dark gothic themes.Playing as somewhat of an RPG/DnD/adventure/roguelike hybrid, the game focuses upon building a party and completing quests through side-scrolling exploration riddled with turn-based strategy for combat. This may sound fairly stock-standard, but the added element of ""stress"" adds a layer of depth unlike any I've seen in a game.Each character has a set amount of HP. Simple? Yes.Each character has a set level of stress at any given point in time. Simple? Not quite.Actions while questing, fighting, resting and returning to town in-between quests will all have an impact on a character's stress; this is what turns an otherwise fairly simple RPG into a challenging, punishing experience of a game. Once stress level on a character hits 100, they turn insane: acting irrational, spreading stress among party members, attacking of their own accord in battles. This is exactly what you want to avoid. I could go on about Darkest Dungeon for several pages, but that would simply be detracting from the amount of time you could be spending actually playing it. Though early access (at this moment), it's easily worth the purchase and will have you cursing for hours on end as your party members trudge through dungeons, are faced with insanity and eventually perish.Buy this game.",Qualbert,http://steamcommunity.com/id/Qualbert

There's the Charge system, which holds unique benefits depending on what class you are. All the classes have their own benefits but all in all, no matter what class you are, you can always use any weapon you want.  For example, want to be a Embermage wielding a pistol in one hand and donning a shield in the other? Be my guest. However, not every skill each class has will be compatible with every weapon.Unfortunately, a lot of the quests are quite bland and are pretty much the same every act. It's usually getting you to travel to a dungeon, complete the dungeon and kill the boss at the end to progress. Side quests range from collecting an item to also going to a dungeon and killing its boss.Once you finish the game, you can proceed into New Game+, holding harder monsters with higher rewards (it starts at your level, too), or you can complete a few maps, which are basically dungeons in themselves, but sometimes hold strange benefits or disadvantages. Alternatively, though, you can check out the Steam Workshop for user-created content -- some of it is amazing!All in all, Torchlight II is a magnificant game, and I feel it was worth the wait (I pre-ordered it then waited months 'till it finally released). I've finished it twice already on an Engineer and Embermage, but already started my third playthrough on an Outlander. I recommend picking this up if you're a Dungeon Crawler fan! It'll be well worth your time. Thank you for reading, and have a good day/night.",Cydran,http://steamcommunity.com/id/Cydran

18377,,2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful,233470,,"Posted January 10, 2014.","This game starts off really well, as the transition from the old 8-bit era to the 3D part is pretty cool. But this transition happens in a space of half an hour and the game turns for the worse after the game becomes 3D. After that it becomes a bad zelda and final fantasy clone.The turn-based strategy is way too easy, as your partner has a heal spell that is effective considering how little damage the enemies do. She doesn't do a whole lot of damage (except for x-crystal, but the hero can do just as well.), there is no limit on how many times you can use her spell and it heals both characters. At the moments when she isn't around, you have enough money to buy a bunch of potions to last you until your partner comes back. Because of this, the battles will get boring and mind-numming very quickly and you'll start running from battles just to get past them.The action-adventure gameplay isn't as bad, as some of the levels have intresting mechanics like shifting back and forth from 16-bit to 3D but these sections don't last as long and they don't get repeated. They should've stuck with these ideas as it could've added more puzzles and ways to get around them. Instead it focuses more on the combat, which is stiff to say the least.Overall, it takes a lot of ideas, some from other games and some entirely unique, and sticks it all together instead of getting a few ideas and expanding upon thoses to make the game feel like an exploration through the action/adventure genre rather than a game that took ideas from other games in hope of it working well. Combined the fact that the game is really short and that it's $10, this game isn't worth getting.",look_at_the_damn_profile,http://steamcommunity.com/id/look_at_the_damn_profile

The game's vast open world with quests and collectibles never feels dull or dead, along with an incredibly beautiful terrain rich with color and life, filled with scattered villages, bandit camps, caves, and powerful creatures. The game has many side quests, most of which will shape the world and the main story line depending on the choices that the player makes. The level of detail that is put into mere side quests is astonishing, with some taking the same amount of time as it would take to complete the main story line of a small-medium sized game. You'll find yourself wandering the world, completing quests yet you'll find that you've barely scraped the surface of the story that The Witcher 3 presents. The gameplay is polished and well-balanced, with fluid and exciting combat and an on-depth crafting and alchemy system.CD Projekt Red have excelled with The Witcher 3, creating the most incredible world I've experienced and a story that will get you hooked from the very beginning, along with incredible gameplay. The Witcher 3 sets a new, and incredibly high standard for both video games, and the RPG genre. This game could very well be the GOTY for 2015.Pros- Incredible visuals- Incredible and massive world- Engrossing story- Well-balanced and enjoyable combat- In-depth crafting systemsCons-None!10/10",sparksflynn,http://steamcommunity.com/id/sparksflynn

Then send it spies to ruin their party and make other parties more strong, however good luck with that. :)If you wish to have a friend to play with, you're able to do that, however be aware that the servers are not up anymore and you will be forced to host your own server through port-fowarding or using a program such as Hamachi, playing online is very interesting and is often more difficult due to the AI sometimes being very predictable.The game does suffer from bugs, game crashes and HUD bugs are very common and get worse the longer you play for one session. If the game does not even launch, it is often Steam or your system and a reinstall is very handy. Game crashes seem to get worse the longer you use a constant game copy, reinstalling this game every time crashes become common is a good idea and modding the game can also cause crashes, however I would reccomend the WW1 mod.I full-heartly reccomend this amazing game, with over 600 hours on Steam and much more off Steam, it helped me learn more in-depth about World War 2 and made me truly see the effects of the war. 9/10+Unique game with much replayability+ Extremly In-depth if you want it to be+ Able to attack a country through unique ways+ Great moding community with WW1 mods to game enhancing mods such as ICE-  Bugs, often forcing a reinstall after a unknown period of time- No official servers",timasaurus,http://steamcommunity.com/id/timasaurus

Sadly The Early Access Game Is Very Poorly Optimized With Some Of The Top Computers Getting Around 25 FPS On Lowest Graphics Which Is A Shame.

14870,,1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful,8870,,Posted July 6.,"A spectacular modern masterpiece. That is the best way to describe Bioshock Infinite.At first Bioshock Infinite seems like a cut and dry FPS with basic mechanics and a nice setting. However, over the course of the game, you come to realise that this is unlike any game ever created- even the original Bioshocks. Gameplay is always dynamic and supports any style of play, and with the DLCs, you are even able to stealth your way through. Vigors add a new  twist to the genre, allowing the player to cast almost magical spells onto your foes- adding another layer to the deep combat systems. The Sky Hook is another mechanic that intesifies and deepens combat further. Traversing a beautiful landscape by soaring through the skies looks and feels magnificent. The AI dynamically adapts to the skyline as well, reacting to all your movements. Additionally, guns feel super solid to shoot, and coupled with the magnificent sound design, have a certain 'punch' to them that alot of other FPS' lack. I do however wish that the gunplay could have been broken up by some puzzles, as it sometimes got a bit repetitive. All in all, despite its short-comings, the gameplay is a fantastic twist to the FPS genre, spicing things up within a somewhat generic category. Graphics are obviously one of the strongest points in this game. The world of Columbia is fully realised within the Unreal Engine 3 and is a specticle to look at- all the textures and lighting especially look fantastic. The first 30 minutes of the game are some of the best, most pure world building portions of a game I have every played. Everything from the characters to the rooms are detailed, well thought out and created with passion. You can tell that Irrational spent alot of time designing each single focus within the dense world. But the main draw of this game is its story. So is it any good? â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING YES. The story in Bioshock Infinite is one to marvel at; one that will be remembered decades from now as incredible- just like the original Bioshock. The reason it works so well, is that it takes its time. You really start to feel emotion for the characters that inhabit this world, and form deep connections. Booker and Elizabeth share amazing character development arcs throughout the entire game, and upon reflecting back at the beginning of your journey- you realise just how much you've been through. Each miniscule of detail in the story was thought through a million times over, and share a multiplex of depth with each other detail. The way Ken Levine and his team were able to craft such a magnificent tale, I will never know. I would go as far as to say this story is BETTER than Bioshock 1. I know that might be hard to believe, but Ken Levine is a master of pen- and this work of his is no exception. And the obligatory twist that every Bioshock has is of course here- and mark my words, YOU WILL NOT BE READY. They outdid themselves once again, and this twist will be remembered for generations to come.TL;DRPROS:- New, fresh gameplay. A twist on the genre.- Marvellous graphics and world.- Story will blow you away. One of the best I've ever experienced.- Characters are well developedCONS:- Sometimes repetitive.OVERALL: 10/10Good job Ken Levine and team. You are masters of game development.",aemon123,http://steamcommunity.com/id/aemon123

Overall I really like this game with a few things that I thought need working on:- Sometimes when I go to change the input for the 'Run' button I cannot push any button I just have to restart and hope for the best- The 'Run' button- The changed controls for the 'Hover' Wisp (I dont know, maybe I'm doing something wrong)- The Snowball Act (Even though it is just one level)- and finally turning whilst using the 'Run' button as it seemed to slow down too much and felt very clunkyI'd rate this game a 7.5/10",bringmeababytosacrifice,http://steamcommunity.com/id/bringmeababytosacrifice

This game is surprising relaxing, casual and amazing experience to play. Got a spare 5 mins before work, school, or even football training? Just launch Floating Point. Playing this game for ten minutes feels like 30, and it is all so rewarding when you can swing yourself across the level at a hundred miles per hour and get that last beam of light to unlock all the traces of where you have been. Once you complete a level and press enter you transfor yourself, a little ball thing, into the background of the previous level. The music is so relaxing and vibrant, and I love how the sound of it gets ""distorted"" when you go under water. When you go under water you lose a lot of momentum and it's a lot harder to get in the water then above the water. Another thing about the water is that you float in it, so it's very hard to get far enough to get those deep level beams of light you need to travel through. The aim of the game is to pretty much fly through these red beams of light (which also get shorter if you hit a wall) and progress through many levels.In all this is a MUST download (as it's a free game), so what are you waiting for? It's only about 54 MB and it's free! Get it before they put a pricetag on this wonderful creation of a game! =D",mr_doominater,http://steamcommunity.com/id/mr_doominater

The game embraces its difficulty by slingshotting you back into the next attempt quickly with generous checkpointing and bite size levels.

I know that all they did was port it to a new engine but at least they could've added in some new walking sounds. Get it on sale, or get it full price. Its worth every penny, trust me. Just keep in mind that there aren't many people who play this, so you might want friends to play with.

You have to get machine pieces and bring them back to where you start to repair a teleporter as your butler, Mr Walters, talks to you. As you get more pieces, more and new, tougher robots come. You have a hunger meter, so you have to scavenge for food in the houses that lay around. At first, your only tools of dealing with the robots are bottles that you can throw to distract them (they don't hurt them) and alarm clocks that you can set to go off - up to 60 seconds of delay. Although, you might find some weapons that will be of use - the hatchet, the pistol, the shotgun, the rifle and even a blunderbuss! All the time, you will have to deal with a Tetris-like inventory. It runs on the Unity Engine, so it is not that intensive: but don't expect great graphics.The game is still in development, so new robots, biomes and items are being added.A definite recommendation.Oh, and may I add: Sir, You are being Hunted.",reywqrrtty,http://steamcommunity.com/id/reywqrrtty

In SCB, you navigate a single screen, platformed environment collecting crates and avoiding enemies. Each time you collect a crate you are given a random weapon, and weapons are progressively unlocked as your total crate count increases. Upon contact with an enemy, the player will die immediately. The game provides a moderately steep difficulty curve, and fluent, twitch-based combat and movement. The crate collecting objective, minimal gameplay and single screen environment are highly accessible and reminiscent of original arcade games.But, due to the simplicity of the gameplay, certain faults can significantly retract from the gaming experience. Whilst the weapons are reasonably well balanced, certain inconsistencies (i.e. disc gun damaging players) can be very frustrating. Also, because of excessively accurate hit boxes, unfair deaths are reasonably frequent. But despite this, Super Crate Box is a fun, addictive and highly accessible arcade experience.",ohsotechnicolor,http://steamcommunity.com/id/ohsotechnicolor

If you grew up watching Dragonball/Z/GT, and enjoy fighters/multiplayer, you'll enjoy this game.You get the storyline mode, as well as a mission-type mode (Single player and CO-OP) the PVP is also very fun and competitive. If you loved dragonball for the plot, youll love this. If you loved dragonball for the action, youll love this too.There is one single thing that should be listed though, unless you have good ping to JP from AU, as well as access and knowledge of port forwarding, you will suffer a lot of connection problems. Mine have since been fixed after forwarding ports. There are a few hackers in PVP, which are easily avoided by playing with friends.You will find no better Dragonball Z to GT experience in a game than what you get from this one. It's worth the money, so is the DLC.And the option of being able to switch the audio to Japanese or English makes it that much betterNOTE: Some features are specific to your region's version of the game.",lemage95,http://steamcommunity.com/id/lemage95

Fallout 3 itself is a remarkable & landmark game, which even tugs at the heart w/ its Main Quest. Also, given the open-world nature of the game and its plenty of side quests to do & land to explore - this continues with making this game a remarkable & landmark game. The game will take the player plenty of hours to complete - at least probably 20+ hours. Now, this isn't even including the 5 DLC's, which also come in this package, each expanding the game at least probably 4-5 hours a piece at least. The DLC's are meaty, each often longer than most new single-player shooter games that cost full price these days! The 5 DLC's expand the game w/ more equipment, quests & areas for the player to explore - Point Lookout & The Pitt are the absolute stand-outs of the DLC's. The User Interface isn't that great, but it is decent enough to get the job done. It could be better - but, that's just a minor complaint. Simply put: if you love RPG's, you absolutely owe it to yourself to play this great game & its DLC's.Grade: A+",mysterd,http://steamcommunity.com/id/mysterd

43499,,6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful,372000,,Posted March 31.,"Tree of Savior is what you expect. A true successor of the so called Ragnarok Online. For this review, I'll be writing on paragraphs divided by pros and cons. I played through ICBT, so I can tell a lot from my point of view.Pros:ToS has a huge amount of options for classes. Large variety of classes and combinations that will most likely suit what kind of class you want best. The adventure is long and grindy, but it's always enjoyable, especially with friends, as you wander around a world masterpiece. The game is very deep too, the level cap is more than 200. The mechanics are mostly Keyboard / Controller based; hitting the enemies are manual. Positioning and tactics matter a lot. Attacks deal in an AoE. It's a step up from Ragnarok's combat mechanics mostly. If you want to go back to the ol' times of MMORPG, ToS is for you.Cons:The biggest problem I have with ToS at the current state is poor optimization. It's said that even the high-end users find the performance to be worse than it should be. For low-end users, crashes are very common due to instability. Everyone should have a stable 60 FPS for high-end PC, and 30 FPS for low-end PC.Also, the story is linear although more variety. You either start from Klaipeda or Orsha, but both are linear in nature.If you don't want to grind, no, this game is not for you.Verdict:7/10. As long as the optimization issue is not fixed, I cannot give this game a high score just yet. I really hope they will fix this up in the near future. It's worth giving a try either way, though :)",Xierra,http://steamcommunity.com/id/Xierra

You will die and you will die a lot!!! Unlike Tiny Barbarian this game will test your skills at every corner, it has a steep learning curve that will punish you at every turn.  How you proceed in Volgarr is to die and learn from your mistakes.  Your health is made up by items that you collect along the way, for example your shield and helemt each add an additional Health Point to your armour, each time you get Hit you lose an item until you finally die. Controls are a bit limited and there are no checkpoints along the way.Being such a hard game makes every level you complete feel like such a mammoth victory, having mastered all the enemys, traps and string them together to safley get you through a level actually gives you a sense of accomplishment.  It has the feel of a Money hungry arcade game forcing you to enter more coins and learn the game so that you can progress.

In fact, it is the opposite of good, it's a rage game. The only difference is that this rage game has the balls to charge you for this crap.One of the main selling points of this game is the music. Is it good? No, the music is annoyingly repetitive. Although I admit it does sound good for the first 2 levels of the game before you realise that it is practically the same thing over and over. Not only that, but there is no other sound at all. Just the sounds of jumping over rocks and trash cans. Also, there are these 'powerup' things that go from Hyper to Mega to Ultra to Extra, and they make the game sound more lively each time. Sounds cool right? Wrong. The music does get more lively until you get to Extra, which turns the music into low, slow sounds that break up your pacing and eventually leads to you losing the level. Speaking of levels...The level design, don't even get me started on the level design. First of all, no checkpoints? Really? I get that it is a kind of 'music' (if you could even call this music) game so you wouldn't want the 'song' to be broken up, but the game is so insanely difficult that it takes more than 30 minutes for a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ 2 minute level. Who thought this was a good idea? ALso, some of the powerups are in difficult to get places, which is good for a running game like this. The only problem is that some of these powerups are almost completely impossible to get. One powerup involves you jumping down a hole then springing back up. The problem here is that the spring throws you into a wall, which of course kills you instantly.So, the rating is probably what you want to see from this random guy on the internet.2/10 - Not recommended to all who wish to keep their sanity.",76561198028982486,http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198028982486

7216,,No ratings yet,333950,,"Posted March 2, 2015.","Now, Don't mistake this game to be anything like space engineers, The people over at Keen have done an amazing job at making this game vary from space engineers, Those of you who have Space Engineers will have to re-think everything you thought you knew about engineering. The Physics complexity, The Graphical beauty and the absolutely stunning soundtrack make this game completely worth the cost! The soundtrack alone is worth buying this game!The downside's are that the game so far has not been completed, so flaws are to be expected, and the structural integrity can crash the game at some point and because it's newer there's a distinct lack of mod's compared to its space-themed counterpart.To sum it all up;Pro's:+Graphically stunning, very good for an alpha, But atleast on my PC, Not too taxing.+Eargasm! The soundtrack is both soothing, and uplifting. If you like medieval themed orchestra, Then the music alone is reason enough to buy this game!+Complex physics.  Something that is hardly ever seen in most games is the formation of rubble in such a believable manner. Your building's will have to stand up to the test of gravity and it really makes you need to think outside the box!+Scroll n' roll. Scrolling with select blocks will give you varients of that block type. This is something i love about Medieval Engineers. Nuff said.+Blockception. You can place a block withing a block withing a block within a bl- (etc.)Con's:-Physics! Y U DO THIS?! Like I said, Amazingly complex and glorious physics and destruction, But these attributes are also a downfall if you build too big! The very structural integrity this game is heralded for is its greatest downfall, requiring you to bear with the limitations of the current engine. Remember, This will probably be changed in later updates.-So, No real weapons? Well, Not yet. You can shoot canonballs but let's be honest. We're all waiting for swords, shields, bows and arrows! The recent addition of Barbarians (destructive A.I.) can't be killed very easily and appear to have their own spiked club as a weapon, which is not available to the player at this time. This will mostlikely change in future updates.Now there are probably some other things, but that's a summary. Also, some blocks are missing from the trailer, My guess is over at Keen, They are fixing up some block dynamics, Checking viability and tweaking the physics engine a bit. The lack of mod's in the steam workshop should be temporary too, as the more people get this, the more modder's will come and grace this gem of a game. You dont even need to own this game to mod it! :DIn the end, I give it a 9.5/10. Good job Keen and thanks for this wonderful addition to my Steam library!",reivehnfliyt,http://steamcommunity.com/id/reivehnfliyt

When you take damage in COD the screen would shake, you would hear grunts and a quick splash of red on the screen in the form of blood would appear. this is why this game feels so dull to me, no wieght to actions.Also mechanicly its dull, with dino's that just run at you and then a couple tanky ones where is the strategic puzzle?

Each level/floor is randomly generated with all sorts of special rooms, combat rooms, secret areas, and of course the boss you will need to defeat to progress to the next floor. The game is perma death, meaning when you die your run is over for good, adding a bunch of challenge to the game. Gungeon has a dodge roll mechanic that is used to avoid bullets, and consumable blanks that destroy all bullets on the screen. These make the game a bit easier.There are many many different guns, buffs and active and passive abilites, allowing for heaps of potential synergies. The game is also chock full of cheesy gun related puns, and references to other games/tv shows etc.Overall this Enter the Gungeon is really fun, but it can be hard and frustrating at times.",76561198074561346,http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198074561346

The mission is rather short, but enjoyable. the real fun is where the robot customization is, being able to have a companion robot with a mister handy booster for maximum speed, two flamethrowers for insects and ghouls, and a hacking module because you dont have a high INT. the customization is unreal and you can make your companion a force to be reckoned with, or a pack mule to carry your stuff (the maximum carry weight on your robot is amazing!)The eye bot pods you can unlock by finding the blueprints in the mechanists' lair is also very helpful. you build one in your settlement, and set it to find either components, ammunition(of any kind! including mininukes, cannonballs, and rail spikes!), or explosives(baseball grenades, pulse grenades, etc)i found this feature extraordinarily helpful when building my bots, and great for upgrading my weaponry, because i didnt have to waste caps on shipments or waste too much time scouring locations for rare materials.(unfortunately you cannot scavenge gold. but every other material is available, including crystal, fibre optics, and nuclear material!)This DLC is definitely worth the 10$ USD i spent on it,and hey, at least it isnt a goat simulator heist.",76561198075749223,http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198075749223

Loot spawns in predefined areas. The map is rather small (smaller then dayz easily). There is a lot of grinding to get later tier items or to build large bases unless you raid a lot. Most of the guns can be hard to handle (That is why i prefer the pistols and bolt action). My advice to new players is to find a server that has a low pop, the closer to zero the better. Then you can learn about the other parts of the game. Also a well hidden base is better than a bigger base any day. Everyone can break down even the mightiest fort given enough time (spent 12 hours once breaking down a castle with grenades). Also google an online map and get used to it. Also take note of loot spawns and areas that have a high resource density.Wooden buildings decay much faster than metal and are easier to break into. When you want to build you have to craft foundations onto which you place pillars (4 in each corner depending on design). You can then place a ceiling on it (on which you can place more pillars since it also acts as a floor) place walls, windows, doorways in-between or place a stairwell in it. It takes a lot of resources to build big buildings as well, and then you have to maintain them on top of that.Animals also tend to spawn near loot areas but you can find some scattered around the map. They are a great source of food and i have never had to go hungry past my first 3 days so actual survival is not that important if you do all right at the start. Once you get to high levels you will start to get bored and either want to raid/pvp or build a big base. After that though there is not too much you can do besides raiding and collecting airdrops.Graphics are okay, buggy but it is in alpha. Sound is okay, gunshots sound nice but might need tweaking. Explosions need tweaking. Not to many glitches and i have had no crashes my self. Netcode seems fine, heaps of servers with little lag.Basically dont get this if you hate games like Nether and dayz (unless you find a nice helpfull server) or you dont understand what alpha is and have a short attention span. I have had fun with it but it has reached a point where there is nothing new for me to do appart from kill people.  Atm probs not worth $20 for what content you actually get but it will be interesting how they expand this and could be worth more then that in the future.",_SNS_,http://steamcommunity.com/id/_SNS_

What makes this game one of the best games is the scenery; destroyed buildings, blown-up cars and other people. The story is very engaging and the loading times are super quick. Im also running this on a crappy little tablet with graphics on high and I still have around 100fps. If you havent already got Half Life 2 get it! Also dont worry if you havent played Half Life (Number 1) because I have not and I understand the  majority of the story.EDIT: Just finished it and it is easily the best game I have ever played. The story is the best and so engaging that I just want to live in City 17 regardless of it's owners. I would like to personally thank Valve for making such a great game and all the voice actors. Thanks so much for a game that I will remember forever.2nd EDIT: Playing through a second time and finishing off some acheivements and trying for 100%. One problem though, is it me or is the hidden acheivement not the one where you through the can at the cop???

I misheard. I thought you said ""how are we gonna get MORE NEGATIVE REVIEWS ON STEAM"".Performance:This game runs horribly. I used to run at low settings, 1080p, with AA and 8x Anisotropic filtering, and run at a solid 60fps. Now I run 900p with AA off and 2x Anisotropic, and the game runs at 40fps. Rocksteady need to sort out their PC port. They had to relaunch there game because of the port, and it went from bad at launch, better after an update, to worse than ever after a 2.5gb patch. Gameplay:The batmobile in the game seems a bit overused. It is used for a lot of puzzles, and gets a bit boring. The combat is as fun as ever, utilizing counters a lot. Rocksteady have added some new moves as well. The new gadgets such as the remote hacking device are fun and well utilized, and are actually very useful in many situations. For example, you can knockout a goon by turning on the escalator, or setting off an explosion. I do find it quite funny that once a goon is knocked out, you can shoot them as much as you like with your lethal cannons and guns on the batmobile. Of course they are not dead though, because that would make it too dark.Missions:There is a good variety of story missions in the game, and a lot of side missions as well. An example of variety in the story is  Scarecrow fills the city streets with fear toxin and you must travel around the city on the rooftops. The final mission of the game involves running around as joker destroying weeping angel like statues of batman.  At this point, I have finished the story, and it is a good length. It did not drag on like Saints row (my opinion as Saints row IV got very boring as I played the story), and is not too short like Mirrors Edge (an enjoyable game, but I was finished with the story within 3 hours). The side missions contain a lot of the regular batman villians, like Two Face and Penguin, and involve stopping their crime gangs for good. These are fun, and give you a lot of upgrade points, which like the other batman games, let you upgrade gadgets, and unlock new moves.Conclusion:Batman: Arkham Knight is a very fun game. The story is enjoyable, and even 29 hours in I am enjoying slowy completing all the quest lines. I just wish that Rocksteady would fix their PC port. It makes the game in some cases unplayable, and I will most likely be refunding the game when I get the oppurtunity.Performance score: 3 (at least it boots up)Gameplay score: 8 (excessive use of the batmobile)Missions score: Side missions: 9 (a lot of batmobile use, but feels satisfying to take down crime gangs and villians)                          Story missions: 9 (great ending, and lots of variety. Again, a lot of batmobile use)OVERALL SCORE: 6 (not reccomended on PC because of performance, but if you own a console, buy it on that peasant machine)",whitelight6,http://steamcommunity.com/id/whitelight6

I've voted like this because at its core the message regarding the human condition is profound and extremely endearing.But in substance, the game is an exploration of ostentation and pig-headedness. Through showing a unwavering inability to compromise one's views towards the expansion of themselves as a character and ineptness at accepting realities beyond your immediate surrounds - I cant really support what either party in the story stood for, how they behave or how they eventually parted ways. It makes me feel indifferent and like they were both overly expectant and self-justifying - especially in the case of Coda. If you went beyond just accepting what the narrator was feeding you it actually became a little repugnant and unecessary and seemed forced - 6 months culminating in a message to say stop talking to me? obviously he has motives beyond getting you to stop talking to him, Im not him so I wont be a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and say exactly what they were but there was something more inciped - but consider the case of the maze in the tower. It was a point of interest as the harsh manner that it espoused your failure with frustration showed he was just trying to inflict the same pain upon you - a pretty selfish thing if im going to be honest.The outcomes were also petty, changing your ways because they upset you then lingering on how someone else ruined it for you was the epitome of this.

39753,,No ratings yet,239030,,"Posted January 4, 2015.","I haven't been riveted by a game in a while. Papers, Please perfectly appeals to my self-proclaimed great attention to detail. It's proven its case by showing that my attention to detail isn't that great after-all (well, when put to a timer). The aesthetic of the game harks back to what I imagine to be Cold War-era Eastern Europe, with tensions high between borders, controlling governments, and a lack of humanity to the common peon.Gameplay is fun, and endearing. The aesthetic is simple, but effective. Border control is somehow made to be amusing. The challenge of stamping passports is slowly increased as more conditions are dictated by the Ministry of Admission. A healthy dose of humour is inserted sporadically by the oddball characters that come your way. The drollness of it all is broken up by the occasional click-and-shoot, and the RPG-style strategising of managing your family's finances (ha!). The game's multiple endings and achievements ensures some replayability.In a gaming world dictated by first person shooters and multiplayer battle arenas, it's hard to say who Papers, Please might appeal to. There is a touch of simulation gaming about it, without it being realistic at all. Again, I found the game compelling, and was sucked in for a few hours on the first run.

Some people say that this game is pay 2 win. But trust me, you can still survive without paying with real money. All you need is teamwork.The guns doesn't have that much difference except the firing speed and control. Its quite complicated if your new to third person cover shooters. But, as you progress,it'll be easy to get killstreaks. You also buy your grenades so you won't see people spamming grenades like crazy. Also, this game has some cool abilities exclusive to each class. You can fry  your enemies with your mini U.F.O thing, or you can scan where your enemies are through an opaque things like walls or cars.(sadly, you can't peek through their clothes....Im just joking!).You can also put a shield around you so that you can go out in the open without taking a bullet in the face. Overall, this game has alot of potential. You should definitely try it.And a little tip: Mystery boxes have some cool or poopy loot in them.

One of the biggest changes to Rust was the rad zones before on the old Rust rad zones were always the most heated zones as they were always being contested now there are simply no rad zones there are barrels which are spread out throughout the map and there is always the occasional air drop every know and again there also made guns more rare which i love because starting as a fresh spawn in the old Rust and trying to get resources i often found myself dying over and over again to people in full kev but now i just mostly see naked men with bows running around. All i have to say is that the new Rust is what a wanted from the old Rust as it improves all the features from the old and makes its a loveable game again.,dootz,http://steamcommunity.com/id/dootz
6653,1 person found this review funny,2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful,311210,Last edited September 1.,Posted August 31.,"This review is ENTIRELY my opinion and is supposed to be informative.SINGLEPLAYERThe singleplayer of Black Ops 3 is so incredibly boring it makes me want to fall asleep. I'm only Rank 6/25 (or something like that), but it's a waste of time. All the single-player camos are boring and bad, so it's not even worth it for the camos. If you're looking for a singleplayer experience, this NOT it.ZOMBIESZombies is a classic Treyarch gamemode first introduced in World at War, and even after Black Ops 1 & 2, this is still incredible.. WITH THE SEASON PASS. I cannot stress enough that Zombies is completely useless if you don't have the season pass. Zombies only has 1 MAP w/o the season pass, which is a bit ridiculous, but regardless, if you DO end up getting the season pass, it's well worth it. There are in-depth easter eggs in every single map, with great detail and attention to the story. IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A ZOMBIES EXPERIENCE, DO NOT BUY W/O SEASON PASS!MULTIPLAYERMultiplayer is probably the most popular gamemode of the 3, but is a bit of a broken mess. The controller support in this game is so incredibly infuriating it makes me want to leap off of a building, and the aim assist is the cause of the problem (instead of having a rant about why the aim assist is so â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed, I'm going to continue). The season pass for Black Ops 3 on PC for Multiplayer only is probably the biggest waste of money ever, as nobody plays the DLC after a few days of release. Though they have started to intergrate the DLC maps into the normal map pool, it's still a bit of a waste.SUPPLY DROP RANT / END OF MULTIPLAYER SEGMENTSupply drops are the worst thing to happen to Call of Duty ever. Activision has â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed over all Call of Duty games since Advanced Warfare (which I got â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing VAC'd on) with micro-transactions, or ""COD Points"". These COD Points can be used on Extra camos and Supply Drops (as of 1/9/16 [D/M/Y]). Supply drops are basically CSGO cases, but instead of getting one item, you get 3 (but you can actually trade in CSGO unlike this game). Supply drops can be earned in-game with Cryptokeys (which can be acquired by playing the game), and you have the choice of a Common Supply Drop, or a Rare Supply Drop. Only Rare Supply Drops can be bought with COD Points, and Rare Supply Drops give you a better chance for rare items. There are probably around 25 of them right now, with half of them being Melee Weapons. It's extremely rare to get these items with Common Supply Drops. And this is the part that pisses me off the most. YOU CAN GET DUPLICATES. Duplicates can be burned for more Cryptokeys, with Common being burned for 1 Cryptokey, Rare being burned for 3 Cryptokeys, Legendaries being burned for 7 Cryptokeys and Epic's being burned for 10 Cryptokeys. So if you get a Black Market weapon you already have.. well then â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ you, because you can only burn it for 10 or 7 cryptokeys. The gameplay in multiplayer is OK and the community is toxic (you might want to rebind some keys). If you're looking for a multiplayer only experience, I would recommend buying the multiplayer starter pack (which only includes multiplayer and some restrictions, but you can upgrade to the full game whenever).I would NOT recommend this game if you are a veteran at Call of Duty, because the ""Exos"" are ridiculous.OVERALLCall of Duty: Black Ops III is an OK game with great developers working on a terrible PC port. I can't help but feel that this platform (PC) is a third-wheel to the COD franchise, with every year having terrible PC ports and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ performance. If you're in it for the gameplay, buy the Multiplayer Starter Pack, if you don't like it, then refund it, if you like it, upgrade and buy the full game.I would rate this game 8/10 on consoles, since it's not so bad bugs & performance wise, but this is PC.I rate this game 7/10 (with Season Pass).I rate this game 5/10 (without Season Pass).",xoffy,http://steamcommunity.com/id/xoffy

The artsyle is charming, the music sets the scene nicely and the story, while sometimes lacking, is overall extremely well written. The one complaint I have with these three games (yes, you get three games for $3), is that they are too short. I completed them all in under 4h, and then proceeded to re-play the games a few times to get all the achievements, and for my own personal enjoyment. Fantastic value for the price of a chocolate bar, it's too bad that Miwashiba will not make any more of these. LiEat IV is a light novel that you can find with a google search, but Miwashiba stated that she won't make any more games. It's just too bad that such a fantastic developer doesn't want to make any more. I would buy any LiEat game in a heartbeat.",deltalink21,http://steamcommunity.com/id/deltalink21

Whilst its number of options and pathways is comparatively limited, Dishonered does a fantastic job of letting the player feel like they're playing their own way rather than playing from a set list of options. Whilst every encounter still feels based on the standard 'stealth until caught' monikier, you're given a lot of toys that really colour every level's detailed high-rising rooftops, awesome-yet-impractical mechanical foundations and its seedy rat-infested underbelly. Dishonered doesn't have a fantastic story (it's actually pretty trite), but its setting is fantastic and every area feels designed with actual city architecture and infrustructure in mind. Scuttling through seemingly-clean bakeries inside a rat or sneaking through filtration vents as murderous angler fish provide alternate routes that feel a part of the world and not convinient security holes. Dunwall is a 'Whalepunk' empire of Victorian routes with excessive wealth and crumbling poverty-striken foundations. One moment you're challenging a duke to a duel outside of a fancy party, the next you're poisoning water at a gang-owned rundown textile mill for a crazy old lady called ""Granny Rags."" Whilst there is definitely more room in future sequels for more unique environments, Dishonered feels like a decent tour of a bizarre and gritty world.It does lose its pacing towards the end, but Dishonered still feels like a funtastic romp through a miserable metropolis.",godberry,http://steamcommunity.com/id/godberry

1677,,No ratings yet,57690,"Last edited April 6, 2015.","Posted April 6, 2015.","Surprisingly, it's a really rather good city-builder*disclaimer, long and detailed review, skip to bottom for final verdictI got Tropico 4 in a humble bundle, kind've only wanting the other games in the bundle. So there it sat in my vast Steam library, not really doing anything. And then, my friend told me about a really good city-builder that he had been playing. I thought, ""oh Simcity, right?"" Wrong. He was talking about Tropico, (Tropico 5 however). At this time, I had forgotten that I even had it. So, when I looked it up on the steam store, I realised that I already had it. So, I gave it a shot. And I was quite presently surprised! So, here is a list explaining the good and bad elements of Tropico 4 and there reasons.Pros+Each little person has their own profile;What was one of the elements that made Tropico stand out was the ability to click on every little person walking around, doing there daily routine. Once you clicked on them, a profile of the character came up, explaining their age, wellbeing, faction, name, where they work and where they live. It would also make the camera follow that person. Sometimes, I would find myself just seeing people go about their daily lives for hours on end.+In the population, there are structured families;A little more of a unnecessary part of the game, (but undoubtedly cool) was the structured families. Sometimes when checking people's profiles, you may find a group of people with the same last name. At first, I thought ths was just due to the developers not putting enough names in. But then, I executed a guy, and then everybody with the same last name as him got enraged. Confused, I looked at the effects of executing someone, and it said; ""victim's family will become enraged"" and thats when I realised, there was families, which is really cool!+A system where technology evolves with time;Much like Civilization V (which is an utterly fantastic strategy game), technology would advance as time goes on. This means, that I might start out with some crappy tenements, but when I research more stuff, I could have super high-tec shopping malls. Nuff said.+The ability of extreme POWER;In this game, you have the power of anything and everything on the island, (apart from the rebels, which we will get to later). None of the decisions will be made for you, you have to make them. There are recomendations for what to build, but I mostly found myself ignoring them, as sometimes they can screw you over.+Rebels;The rebels system in this game is rather good. It's simple, when someone becomes too unhappy with the island, they will become a rebel. Rebels can and will screw you over. They will start fires, attack buildings and people and generally become out of control.+Disasters;Perhaps copying other citybuilders, this game has disasters. Dont worry though, you won't be having meteors or aliens or...dinosaurs *cough*Simcity*cough*. Just normal things like nuclear bombs or volcano eruptions or earthquakes. And it won't just be mildly annoying either, it will seriously screw you over. Once, when I built my city next to a volcano, thinking it would look pretty cool, lets just say it wasn't cool when flying blobs of lava engulfed the city and I went financialy in debt.So, thats the list of things which I think are pretty cool in this game. Now, we will talk about the cons.Cons-Limited time;The thing I can think of straight off the bat is that it has a limited amount of time for a game, even in sandbox mode! Sure it is a while, but one time, I built a really great city...and then I couldn't play anymore because my ""mandate had run out"", and that was on maximum time. Sure, it adds realism, but sometimes fun should overweigh how realistic it is. This is where Just Cause 2 shined, now you might be thinking, ""what the devil, what on Earth has that got ot do with Tropico?!"" well, my friend; nothing. I was just bringing it up. Anyways, the reason Just Cause 2 was so fun is that it was completely unrealistic. Tropico should get some inspiration off that.-Lack of help;One of the annoying things about this game is that it just throws you in with ""build a city"". This is a large downside, as the game is quite complicated in the financial part of things. Alot of the time, I found myself looking at my amount of money, going down by the thousands, completely confused why.-Graphics;Now, I would like to point out that this is a very small and minor problem, especially considering it's a citybuilder. But the graphics are a little lacking.Final VerdictSo, we are down to the final verdict, and, if you couldn't already tell with the big blue thumbs up stamped on, I most certainly recomend Tropico 4! Even though it has flaws, I can still say this is a great, solid citybuilder. Thank you for taking some time to read this!",76561198074763789,http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198074763789

It was announced to the public on August 12, 2011, and is developed by Valve Corporation and their partner, Hidden Path Entertainment. The game was later released on August 21, 2012 for the Playstation 3, Xbox 360, Microsoft Windows, and OS X and later Linux as a downloadable title.Counter-Strike: Global Offensive started off as an Xbox 360 port of Counter-Strike: Source by Hidden Path Entertainment. Seeing this as an opportunity to expand the franchise, Valve turned it into an entirely new game.[1]Jess Cliffe confirmed the title ""Global Offensive"" on the official Steam forums on August 11, 2011,[2] while Valve later confirmed with its official announcement on August 12, 2011[3].Counter-Strike: Global Offensive uses the latest version of the Source engine and is not built off of Counter-Strike: Source. After the success of the previous game, Valve wanted the newest game in the franchise to cater to both the casual and competitive community by including a matchmaking system as well as support for dedicated servers.Valve announced the beta would begin in October, but after receiving feedback from professional players who had been invited to playtest earlier versions of the beta, Valve decided to delay the beta [4]. After addressing the majority of the issues the closed beta started on November 30, 2011 to a pool of around 10,000 select players. After almost a year of the closed beta, Valve opened the beta up starting August 14, 2012 to anyone who had pre-ordered the game.As of yet, the console versions have not been updated and are extremely different when compared to their Steam counterpart. It is currently unknown whether or not Valve has plans for updating these versions. Updates to the game after its release can be tracked at Valve's Product Updates channel. A community grassroots effort to better document, organize, and track the resolutions of existing bugs and issues has been acknowledged by Valve and the unofficial CS:GO Bugs and Issue Tracker is maintained by the 64bitVPS ",cyvoxfromyoutube,http://steamcommunity.com/id/cyvoxfromyoutube

In addition to this all stats were wiped. A move to steam like this would have been in the works for at least 2 months - so essentially my money was taken without any intention of providing the full duration of the service.In addition to this they have failed to provide a copy of the Terms of Use which I've requested despite this being the grounds for them refusing the refund.It's worth noting that when I say them I am not talking about Steam I am talking about Quake live/ID software/Bethesda (whomever manages their support/billing)Overall it's essentially Quake 3 online - it's fun if you can get a server that's actually got some people in it.

10043,,21 of 24 people (88%) found this review helpful,389220,Last edited January 25.,Posted January 25.,"If you didn't already notice, this game's concept is loosely based off of the Maximum Overdrive movie in the 80's. Except in this game, you get to play as the machines taking over the world. The gameplay is fun, and very satisfying. The visuals are nice. They are somewhat akin to that of Katamari Damacy. As of right now, there are only 3 modes, all of which have different goals (Did not get to play the Sandbox Mode when I tried the game, but it's basically like the other modes, just with no goal). In arcade mode, you try to destroy as much as possible, to score as high as possible within 3 minutes. In Gman elimination mode, you must destroy a certain number of MIB (Men In Black) before the time runs out. Overall, the game was fun, and should get better with more refining whilst in early access. The only gripe I have with the game, is that the controls feel a little strange, mainly when operating the camera when you aren't in a vehicle, and are searching for one to control on the map. Overall though, i would recommend this game :)If you're interested, i made a video on the game, which i've put below.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGQBtQ-57vQ",disizmehprofile,http://steamcommunity.com/id/disizmehprofile

The gameplay is well put and will be very familiar if you have ever played the original Ace of Spades and not the piece of crap remake. The game also features two editors. A map editor and a character editor. The editors at first seem diffcult but once you find out what does what you should be able to use them just fine. The main thing I like about this game is the fact that you can have your own personalised character skin which you create yourself, which can take some time.I'd recommend people buy this game now while it is still in the early stages, so you can see the game evolve into something greater. I'm even sure once more people find out about this game it will top that shotty remake of Ace of Spades. So come on down and join the battle.10/10",Podrigo,http://steamcommunity.com/id/Podrigo

What is Unturned, you may be asking? Well, it's an indie zombie survival game, packed with plenty of features. Let me run through them.Looting, Inventory, and CraftingSo, Unturned has a fairly in-depth looting and inventory system.- Items have physics, so if you, for example, drop a log down a hill, it will roll down. Apart from that, there are various locations where you can gather loot, such as grocery stores, pharmacies, barracks, on ships, in containers, and more.-  The inventory system is very in depth, each piece of clothing you equip will give you more inventory slots to carry more items. There is also different pieces of armour that protect from damage inflicted by bullets.-  As for the crafting, when you get different items, you can combine them to create makeshift weapons, vaccines, barricades, and even vehicles.Maps and serverlist- In Unturned, there are 3 different official maps: PEI, Washington, and Yukon. Washington is a purely PVP map, Yukon is a purely Survival map, and PEI is somewhere inbetween.- The Serverlist is a huge improvement, instead of connecting via IP, now there is a list which you can browse and filter out difficulty, security (VAC-secured/Non-VAC-secured), first/thirdperson, and Workshop, which brings me onto my next point.Workshop mods and map editor- Yup, Unturned has Workshop Mods, which allows people to upload new vehicles, maps, and weapons, for others to download and try out.- Map Editor: Yes, this is also a thing. It's used to create maps to upload to the workshop, and you can place objects, transform terrain, put player and item spawns, etc. Pretty useful, but baking materials requires a pretty beefy PC (or otherwise a couple-minute-wait)Weapons and Vehicles.In Unturned, there are a variety of weapons and vehicles.- There are 4 Assault Rifles, 4 Carbines, 3 Shotguns, 2 LMGs, 6 pistols, 1 Railgun, 1 Rocket Launcher, 1 Nailgun, 5 bows, 3 sniper rifles, 2 sharpshooter rifles, and 6 civilian rifles.- As for vehicles, there are golf carts, vans, sedans, hatchbacks, trucks, roadsters, quad bikes, snow mobiles, tractors, taxis, buses, snow explorers, ambulances, police cars, fire trucks, Urals (tan and forest), APCs (amphibious, tan and forest), Humvees (tan and forest), Jeeps (tan and forest), racecars, and 3 different types of makeshift vehicles (1 seater, 4 seater, 6 seater)- There are also two planes (one sea-plane, one normal), four helicopters (Skycrane type helicopter, a Police helicopter, a Hummingbird, and a Huey in tan and forest.), and three boats (jetskis, a speedboat, and police boat.)Weapon skins and cosmeticsSo there are also weapon skins and cosmetics, cosmetics being applied to your character and changing the look, and weapon skins change the look of your gun, ranging from camo skins to glowing, luminescent skins that sell for dozens of dollars.BuildablesIn Unturned, you can build entire bases, or just barricade up a pre-existing house. Freeform buildables allow you to angle walls, barricades, traps, etc, and also allow you to attach them to cars, turning that crappy old Sedan into a tank using metal sheets and barbed wire, or putting crates in a helicopter to transport gear around.ConclusionThat just about wraps up my Unturned review. Thanks for reading this far.There's drinkable maple syrup. 10/10.",justthathelicopterpilot,http://steamcommunity.com/id/justthathelicopterpilot

However, it's still one of the most popular and most played games on Steam. Garry's Mod is an endless sandbox game which is a sandbox version of the well and known played game, Half Life 2. This allows the user to interact with many things such as objects, cars, ragdolls, etc. From this, the user is able to create anything, they can build contraptions, boats, vehicles, houses, towers, etc. The possibilities are endless! From my experiences, I have overall spent 3,000+ hours onto this game and I've never gotten bored of it yet, not even a little since not only does Garry's Mod include Sandbox mode, there are many more other modes. Some made by Garry and the rest made by the Garry's Mod Community. In addition, Garry's Mod also includes a workshop which allows people to upload their work of art, new items such as weapons, maps, vehicles, etc. Garry's Mod is mostly made up by the community. Anyways, I highly recommend this game to everybody highly because of the price and the infinite possibilities.And there's the other side.

Two years have passed and Alan Wake is still missing! The story again is written and plays out as it does in Alan Wake but this time the horror story that comes to life is about Alan Wakes doppleganger, a warped and twisted version of himself known only as Mr. Scratch. As this is Alans own story he must battle though the Arizona desert and rewrite reality to stop his doppleganger from re-entering reality as Alan Wake and to prevent himself from being trapped in the darkness forever!  The story is about stopping your nemesis but how the story progresses is quite different. To defeat Mr. Scratch you must gather the whole storyline (manuscript pages) by revisiting parts of the story ""DÃ©jÃ  vu"" and in each instance you will go back in time until you find the correct pieces of the story and join them together. As Mr. Scratch has warped reality he will send you back in time to discourage you from finding the pieces! Gameplay is identical to the orignal except for a few new weapons and of course SPIDERS! YES â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING TAKEN SPIDERS!Pros:-Light as a weapon-Explains some backstories in it like how Alice and Barry are doing etc etc-Like its successor distrubing and horrifying-Narration takes a different approach similar to how it is done in The Twilight Zone-The arcade feature is lots of fun :P-Great looking game Cons:-The game is pretty short. a whole universe of American Nightmare would've been good-Gameplay is pretty linear right at the start and the fact you have to revisit parts of the game although cool can be boring!But a crtitical success like its predecessor, ticks all my boxes! 10 Foxes out of 10 foxes!",RAINZFOXX,http://steamcommunity.com/id/RAINZFOXX

I've had some of the best times playing with friends on Sandbox and Trouble in Terrorist Town and murder and things like that. There are infinite add ons and so much fun to be had.But the multiplayer public servers are awful sometimes.If you have no friends online and you don't feel like sandbox, you can go on to multiplayer online to open servers to play TTT, murder, Prop Hunt, etc... But the people on these servers are just awful most of the time. What I've noticed is that there's a very limited selection of the types of people in Garry's Mod. Either it's the squealers that have the most annoying voices sometimes and say vulgar things, or 18 year olds that sound like they have nothing to do with their lives. I'm not saying all people are like this, but it's just how it usually is. RDMer's in TTT are the worst who kill for no reason, and another thing in TTT is how people are suspicious of the littlest of things. I cannot recommend the multiplayer servers.Another cheap sort of way to get money is to buy Counter-Strike: Source along with it. That's another $15 on the $10 price tag, and you (like me) may think ""I don't want to buy it"" and will probably wonder why it comes as a bundle. See, the thing is, that in Garry's Mod, if you don't have the certain texture or addon for an item or map, there will be huge red error signs and purple and black squares so you can't see the items. And some of the neccesities for this game in terms of maps and textures come with Counter-Strike: Source. And if you don't, you have to go online and find ALL THE TEXTURES and ALL THE MAPS in a bundle, open up your Steam folder and dragging them in. These packs take about half an hour to download, and you need to download all the gamemodes, excess maps and so many other things if you want to play online properly.  I mean, come on, at least give us a warning guys. To me this seems like a ripoff if you didn't know and a cheap way of getting money.Overall, I really love Garry's Mod, but I love it the most when I'm playing with friends on a private match or by myself in Sandbox. If you're gonna buy it for online multiplayer, I do not recommend it. If you're going to buy it to play with friends and the occasional online multiplayer, I fully recommend it.Pros:-Fun gameplay-Great gamemodes-A lot to do and downloadCons:-Bad community-Textures and addons (sometimes)I will keep Garry's Mod at a 7/10(i know this is a very negative review, but I just wanted to let you know the bad about Gmod before you buy it)",DarkTitan9174,http://steamcommunity.com/id/DarkTitan9174

Be warned.]Life is Strange is an unusual ride; a blend of story and deeper meanings mixed in with some hints of the supernatural. Themes revolve around morality, decision making, what could have been, who should come out on top, or whether anyone should at all; but most of all it makes you think about basic humanitarian needs and how similar we are in the long run.Or at least it did for me. Maxine is a quiet and introverted photographer whom has returned to her home town after five years away, as such I can relate to her character in various ways. You are presented opportunities to help others at risk to your own safety, which is something I personally regret not being able to do in previous scenarios in my own life.As such, this conflicts with other characters whom may have been threatening the ones you most wished to assist, which further reinforces a feeling of loss, as they may not deserve your pity, but nonetheless are also a person, with a personality and dreams, which you have helped to hinder or obfuscate in some way in order to help your preferred character.Episode One goes along a solid path, and I will most definitely be purchasing the subsequent episodes, as I believe they will make me think and cry as I have with this episode.What a work of art.I'm not going to go into detail about the graphics or sound, but I believe they were beautiful in their own way.If you enjoy reading, listening and absorbing a fantastic story patiently, I recommend this to you.",deynarian,http://steamcommunity.com/id/deynarian

As you start the game, the excellent music and voice acting will surprise you. The game starts out looking like a generic action game with a few interesting mechanics (such as the world building itself in front of you) but you will quickly realize that there is a huge variety of weapons you can use in this game; in fact, I'd say that the combat system is one of its strongest points. The plot is also not bad, with a little bit of flashback to flesh out the characters in the game, a couple of plot twists, and multiple endings. Without spoiling anything, I will say this: one of the ending sequences is possibly one of the more gripping ones I've played through.And when you finish the game, you will probably want to play it all over again.

It would be nice if the game were ported and configured to be a bit more PC friendly like the franchise's newest addition.But this aside, DMC3 is definitely my all-time favourite game in the series.The controls are solid, the game feel is fluid, and it's just dang fun to play! I couldn't think of a different game from the series I would recommend one plays first than this.And with that, you'd have to play this first.

24526,,No ratings yet,255710,,"Posted March 13, 2015.","Ok im only 15 hours in, as steam states, but i feel like i've seen enough of the core mechnics to give my impressions of this game. The game itself is amazing. It's the simcity of your dreams, no really i'm not kidding, this is what simcity should have been. The simulation model works well, the ai adapts to new routes etc easily, and like i imagine happens in the real world people don't just instantly start taking the new roads you build, most of the time it takes a day for the first people to even start using your shiny new roads. It's almost a word of mouth system, where once 1 person uses it they tell people about the new road and it expands from there until its a basic part of the infrastructure. Everyone has their own houses, own work, own school locations etc, people do what people do, they are unpredictable in the most natural way, Traffic congestion is something to consider, but its not the stupid issue that it was in simcity. Sometimes if you plan poorly there will be consequences to your traffic plans, i for instance made a single intersection the hub of my city, while for a long time it was fine, after i placed by 3000th hex of industrial in the industical zone i soon found that my streets were filled with trucks transporting cargo to and from the industry buildings, in mass, like seriously mass there was hundreds, and everyone going in or out of my city had to take a single intersection, this lead to car jams that could span for miles, i even made a mistake on the entrance to my city too, that made the highway backup for miles aswell, this isnt as simple to fix as it may seem. but eventually i believe i have it fixed. but thats the key. IT IS FIXABLE. This is not like simcitys traffic system where once you get to the 10th hour your city is completely screwed. There are buses and trains and even boats! (Which i havent yet built i'll admit) i made a train station for cargo to ease some of the road congestion, however that actually made more traffic issues because everyone was taking a single road. so i made a road with the entire idea of having these trucks on it, they travel above everyone else and go straight to the industrial sectory, this effectively solved part of the issues i had been having, but frankly, like in the real world, there is no quick fix, you cant just build a single road and expect it to fix every problem, yes it will help and yes the ai is smart enough to know this new road is a better option for some of the population to take, but it is not going to instantly fix your problems in most cases.i have one and only one complaint i can level at this game, i have seen some issues with the vehicles running into each other and occasionally clipping through each other, but in most cases one of the vehicles will eventually realise they they are about to, or have hit someone and react as if the other person has right of way and will stop and fix the problem, this is PURELY a visual thing, there is no gameplay reprocussions at all. It is however a negitive to the game so i thought i would mention it. I have no issue at all recommending this game, the price is not even worth mentioning, i wish i'd not bought simcity and this cost twice as much, then i'd be getting my money. P.S. A quick tip, think about your roads, if your fire trucks can't get to a fire, you will loses houses... You have been warned.",AkkarinDarkmoor,http://steamcommunity.com/id/AkkarinDarkmoor

Played the standalone, should've bought rust instead.My first experience:I spawn at Balota. Nice and happy due to the fact oh yay I can get a gun. I was wrong, too many bandits and shooting near Balota so I decided to go to Cherno and have fun. On the way I found some food and a bag and a helmet. First person I meet is really nice and I talk to him and stuff but the first thing I know he knocks me out and steals my pants and food. Well â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ that guy. I finally wake up from the 30 minute knock out time which there is no timer to help you and run away. I go down the road and meet another dude who was just punching the air. Talk to him and he is nice, I really don't care if he knocks me out at this point cause I will probably just quit the game rather than wait another 30 minutes. Next thing I know, BOOM two bandits come out with guns aiming down their sights at me and the dude who only have our fists out. They tell us to surrender so I am quickly mashing buttons to try and surrender (first time playing so I had no clue what button) and they decided to hatchet me, knock me out and then leave me for zombies to eat me. I just left. This game legitimately sucks â™¥â™¥â™¥. But wait, just to be even more awesome don't forget to add the fact the game has no cars, loot is near impossible to find, when you find food you need a sharp object oh and the fact everything is so glitchy it is near impossible to play.I tried getting back into the game but everytime I spawned it was night time, I had a torch but due to DayZ glitching, my torch was facing behind me and I had no way of seeing loot.10/10 reccomend you do not buy this game. Go buy the mod instead, sure it may be an old game but it is sadly much much better than DayZ Standalone will ever be. Oh and add the fact DayZ Standalone probably won't be finished until 3 years time and in 2 years time they finally add cars.",ShamPowWow,http://steamcommunity.com/id/ShamPowWow

They even go to as complicated as following a series of mini-quests and dungeons in order to complete the Quest.- HousingNow, the ""Housing"" in Mabinogi is not your usual home-like area.The ""Homestead"" that you own from level 10 onwards, is actually different for everyone depending on their tastes. There are three locations to choose - Human area which is Grasslands, the Elven area which is a Desert, and finally the Giant area which is Snow.While you get to choose your location, when you level your Homestead up (yes, it has levels!) - you can then build more unique structures. Everyone's Homestead will be different.- RacesThere are three Races to choose from, upon your initial character creation.Human. Giant. Elf.Each Race will of course have bonuses and different specialties.For example - Humans are the only ones who can use two swords.Elves are extremely amazing Archers, while the Giants have more Health and Strength, and more powerful 2-handed weapons.- Marriage & FamilyYes, in Mabinogi there is a Marriage system.You can get Married to the opposite Gender, or even the same Gender!As for Family - If you get Married, you can create a Family.A Family can consist of yourself and your partner, and up to 6 Children.There is a Family Rule that can be set (example: No dropping items). It will reeset every week I believe, and it will show a counter for those who break the rule.- Pets / MountsYou can obtain Pets and Mounts in-game.Most of the better ones are from the Cash Shop (NX / Karma Koin).Some pets are simply just that - Pets. Both a Pet and a Mount will have inventory for you to store your items. Mounts on the other hand, can be land-based, or have the ability to fly as well.- Rebirthing""Rebirth"" is something unique this game offers. You can Rebirth every so often up to level 1000 Total, from there onwards you will actually need to Rebirth every week or purchase character cards to use to Rebirth.Rebirthing a character will give you the option to change your character appearance, level, age and even gender!- LevelsThere are two variants of levels in Mabinogi.Your level, which is basically your ""combat"" level. Everything you do will earn you exp, which will contribute to this level.There is also Exploration levels. To level this up, you basically have to do Exploration Quests, or go out into the Wilds in Iria (Elves and Giant area), and search for unique hidden objects and items, which you can trade in for EXP and Gold.To level up anything, you will need AP which can be granted upon every level up.The higher your ranks go in a skill, the more AP it will require to level up.- RanksSkill ranks go from the following order (worst to best)NoviceFEDCBA987654321 - Max RankAnd now, to my favourite part...- Non-Combat SkillsNon-Combat Skills are extremely variable.Want to spend your time Cooking tasty treats? Become a Chef!Feel like crafting your own Clothes? Become a Tailor!Want to laze around and spend your time Fishing? Then do so!There are many non-combat skills to find and master.The one unique one which makes Mabinogi different than other games, is simply my favourite;Musical Instruments & Composing.You can re-create songs inside of Mabinogi.Want to play Skyrim Theme? Done.Want to play Game of Thrones theme tune? Done.Pokemon Battle Theme? Done.If you wish to give it a go and enjoy playing, feel free to play with us.Server: TarlachMy in-game name: Alyxa",iAlyxan,http://steamcommunity.com/id/iAlyxan

18054,,No ratings yet,570,Last edited May 2.,Posted May 2.," DotA 2 Review  Introduction DotA is a game developed by Valve Corporation and is the second installment for the Defence of the Ancient series.  It's Avaliable for all current platforms and is playable on all of them although there is a few bugs and perfromance issues for Apple Computers. Development of DotA started in 2009, when the original developer IceFrog were hired by Valve. Overview DotA is  a MOBA (Multiplayer online battle arena) that relys heavliy on teamwork and communication.  Dota is played in matches with 2 teams with 5 players on each team, both teams have a base they need to defend in the corner of the map. The objective is to attack the enemy team and to destroy there Ancient before they destroy yours. During a match every player is able to control 1 out of 112 playable ""Hero"" character that all have different Skills, Abilities and Play Styles. During the match the player is able to collect gold by killing creeps or other heros and using the gold on buying items from a shop thats located in different areas of the map. History Dota was first developed by IceFrog as a mod for Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos. It was praised by the community for it's gameplay and Production quality.  It was then brought back to life by Valve in a sequel as we know it by today called DotA 2. Since it was first released DotA was featured at several world tournaments. At one point it was the most popular and most discussed free, non supported game mod in the world.  Gameplay DotA 2 is a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game that is three dimensional graphical environment. There a 2 teams named Radient and Dire. Each team has 5 players and can each choose from a pool of 112 Heros. The player can level up there hero by killing creeps/neutrals or heros and then will recieve gold which they can spend on items in the shop. There hero levels up by gaining XP (Experience) which will make the hero become more powerfull. Whenever a hero gains a level the player may unlock/levelup a ability for there hero to use. Each hero is influenced by it's primary attribute: Strength, Agility or Intelligence. Graphics Dota has had a update about 3-4 months ago that updated the engine to Source 2 which was the first Valve game to use the Source 2 engine. Before the source to update the graphics were very virbant and had good colour but not good depth and shadow to to surroundings and to the heros themselfs. Now since the Source 2 engine has came out the map and heros look amazing and everything has amazing detail to them. In the ""new"" Source 2 engine they have great setting options for low budget, not the greatest performance computers, to custom built computer's that have the ability to max out every setting. The Video tab includes a simple slider to adjust all graphical options in one or to tick or uncheck boxes that are best suited for your computer. Conclusion In my opionion DotA is the best MOBA out at this moment and has captured the minds of thousands and is the top played steam game on the steam charts. I would reccomend to all to have a go and see what you think. Even after my 590 hours of DotA 2 i still havent got a hang of everything and there is still lots to learn and the communitiy are very willing to teach you. Although it has a steep learning curve once you get the hang of the game it can be truly satisfying playing with a team or by yourself with randoms and working as a team to kill the enemy's ancient.

The combat is really free-flow, smooth and satisfying in every hit. The story would not impact you the same way games like Portal or HL-series do but it does leave memorable moments. It could really be summarized to ""Punch, save someone, Punch, win :D""I wished there was a arena mode or something that can let me punch people indefinitely, but the closest you get is the ranked challenges :IRecommended, gameplay is smooth, polished and well done.Recommended: 9/10",merrycookieradiator,http://steamcommunity.com/id/merrycookieradiator

If you are using Mac, you may also interested with this.What I love and confirmed:+ TONS of player models.+ TONS of maps.+ A server with 15 players.+ Boss fight epic.+ Fast....+ FOV can be set to 180. <3+ A time killing game.What still not yet improve:+ Can only play with lowest graphic setting.+ Keyboard setting can only be changed by using binding console.I would say this game is really worth to play, or at least try it!If you want to try this game out for Mac before developer update, follow this intruction:http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=606904804",rokudoan,http://steamcommunity.com/id/rokudoan

56136,2 people found this review funny,No ratings yet,730,,"Posted September 21, 2014.","CS:GO. The 3rd Major installment in Valve's Counter Strike series. I've found myself playing it a lot lately. It's a nice change from the normal ADS, shoot, kill, respawn, wash rinse repeat that Multiplayer FPS games have become. It does have a difficult learning curve though. If you expect to login the first time and be Global Elite, you've got another thing coming. I've played around 150 hours now and I still find myself very low on the Ranked Spectrum. It's an amazing game, and if you're like me and things like cosmetics appeal to you, this is perfect! I love going into a game and hearing people saying they like my skins. Don't know why, I just always have. ",nu7,http://steamcommunity.com/id/nu7

It is a blast to play with friends and even by yourself. L4D2 has loads of achievements and these play a great part in the replayable aspect of this game. However this game does have some downsides such as backtracking levels and infinite spawns. I would recomend this game to any person who loves to shoot zombies in the face and have a good time doing it.8/10 would play again.,76561198085916165,http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198085916165

No matter what weapon you have as long as its melee NEVER go head on on a zombie sneak up behind and heavy attack the head cause when you need to attack heaps the game will decie to quit on you and no matter how much you click you won't be able to attack and this aspect makes the game almost impossible to pay cause you can die from 1 zombie which in a zombie game is too hard even on hard in any zombie game i've ever played.,76561198058864606,http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198058864606

From my experience the game is good, it is certainly not a fitting end to the Batman Arkham trilogy (origins didn't exist). I was surprise that 70% of this game is Battank simulator 2015, not pleasantry surprise but definitely surprised.

I would recommend this game to people who are at least kinda familiar with the story, as things change due to the darkness from Mira and Towa, 2 of the few new characters introduced to the series. The DLC's are pretty good, you get new abilities and characters Revival F DLC doesn't have story mode. ;-; Also, watch Team Fourstar's gameplay of this game on YouTube or their website.

I am not sure if this is to accommodate Console gamepad gameplay, but as a FPS PC player, this factor is very annoying. It also appears about half the speed of ET:QW which I thought was excellent in terms of movement.Unfortunately, Reflex type gaming is becoming part of history.",AzzX,http://steamcommunity.com/id/AzzX

39032,,1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful,225540,,Posted February 7.,"Ok... First off, I would like to point out that I am using a 1200$ custom computer I had built, so I had more control over the specs than others who are writing reviews. Second, said computer meets and exceeds (slightly) the minimum requirements for the game to run. And oh how smoothly it does. The main problem with people writing reviews in the middle of development and patches, is that a review is made trashing on the game for problems, is upvoted to the top so everyone sees it, then a few days later a patch comes out fixing most of the problems listed. Another problem is people don't actually know what they are doing, and buy the game using a computer not powerful enough to run it. Hence, the refund feature.For me, using a computer that just barely meets the minimum specs, and having played it on Xbox One, which was decent at the best of times, this game runs smooth as a dream. With many problems and bugs fixed, I can run it with my OK desktop at easily 60FPS with medium settings enabled, and even then it still looks absolutely gorgeous. For a stress test, I downloaded a mod allowing bottomless clip, and nuked the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ out of a base. No lag or issues whatsoever. The only problem I have about this game, and I dont say that about every game, is that the control scheme, when put into context with other PC games, is really weird. I would recommend taking about 10 minutes to reconfigure it.All in all, this game is amazing, and the mod fanbase looks really promising. Just, make sure that your computer meets the MINIMUM specs for the game, and if it doesnt, ask for a refund. simple as that. Enjoy.",76561198139439978,http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198139439978

Where to begin...- Firstly, this game is the game that EA's Simcity should have been, except about 1000 times better. More buildings, more options, better gameplay mechanics and generally more everything!- Secondly, The gameplay and the customisation feature of this game are truely its strong point. With thousands of Workshop items, assets and vechicles created by a community of dedicated fans that are added to your game with a simple click. This adds a whole new level to a game which no other rival city builder can truely compare to. Did I mention that these Workshop add-ons are FREE???- Thirdly, The Developers ACTUALLY CARE ABOUT THE GAME. That is one thing that EA missed on with Simcity, EA just rode the current of their popularity river that the Sim series has created and as soon as the game was released, the game was mostly left to cough, splutter and die due to its lack of new features, AI problems and repetitiveness. Simcity did see a few updates but nothing compared to the love this game has recieved from the developers.This game has problems though, it has to be said. I have experienced problems during my play time, mainly around the stability on my PC, especially seeing as I am not running your typical /r/pcmasterrace beast machine. Asides from the occational lapse of framerate, crashes can occur. In the past, I have been left with a few hours of progress wiped because of foolishly not saving my progress. Collosial Order seem to have fixed this as crashes seem to happen less frequently then it used to but I do still see a occasional drop of FPS in my game, but again, I am not running an epic PC. Thinking of it, this game is so addicting that I have had to force myself to save or enable autosave.But that's really it, a lot of pros and a few tiny cons. Cities: Skylines is a must have for gamers who like Simulation games, City Builders, Moddable games and a whole lot of mircomanaging. I am yet to try out the new After Dark expansion pack that was released today (25/09/2015) but seemingly has added a whole lot of depth to this game that is already deep enough to compare to that of the Pacific Ocean.What are you waiting for? Buy the damn game already!EDIT (10/03/16): I highly recommend buying the game with the extra DLCs. Although it will set you back a bit more, you will be supporting future development of the game and the extra features are mostly worth it. Think of it as a virtual highfive to the devs.",julez225,http://steamcommunity.com/id/julez225

24528,,No ratings yet,241930,,"Posted October 8, 2014.","This game is... it's just too good for words. Not only is the gameplay solid and very fluid as well as intuitive (Though control reminders are given passively in the bottom right corner if you need them). The graphics are amazing, Orc armor looks amazing and slowly gets better as the orcs rise in the ranks. The animation quality is off the charts, i don't believe i've ever seen a game to date with animation quality as good as this has. The animations don't even seem to clip or stutter as you switch between attack moves. I loved the music and sound assets aswell, very suiting to the world. Voice Overs are great quality, suit the characters yet still understandable (In relation to the orc voices).The story, if you are in to lord of the rings and the lore surrounding it you NEED this game. No question, I'm not a lore person, in most games i'll skip cut scenes and i did start on shadow of mordor too, but i don't even know when or how buut somehow i became invested in the storyline and i ended up watching all the cut scenes and the conclusion at the end is amazing, i loved every part of this story and that's not something i say usually.All in all this game is amazing, if i had anything negitive to say about it is that it is somewhat of a short game, steam clocks me at 20 hours at this point, i have completed the story and some of the side missions however, there are many many more. When the story finished i just wanted more. I am truely sad that the story finished.

Let me just say when you first step foot into this game you are already having a blast , the Prologue could of been shorter but it was enjoyable. half of the hours i have played was co-op with my mates , we just ran around and leveled up our agility mostly , and it was is endless fun, the story isnt anything special though , its short , easy , and forgetable in my opinion, if it were more slowed down, i guess i would have enjoyed it but it just was to quick , but thats not what its about , its about freerunning the main feature in this game , it so fluint , u could spend hours just running around and leveling up your player.This game , well lets just say , if i can run around for 2 hours without doing anything , no missions nothing , and still have fun , its a brilliant game ,and if you think about it not many games can do that. now if you think GTA 5 is open world wait until you get a load of this , you can climb anything you see , you can break anything you see , and you can nearly get into all the buildings , it is open world , TOOO THE MAX , so i truely think this game deserves game of the year , but its not up to me , so why dont you find out for yourself!!!!!!!!!!!!10/10",434546464,http://steamcommunity.com/id/434546464

And i hated it, i thought it was a broken piece of Sh*t. Then Alien Isolation came out and it showed me there is still hope for a great Aliens game, even though it wasnt my game (on the count that i wanted to kill the xeno not run away) I could see how it would be fun, and then i just stoped playing it. I heard that Acm was better on PC than on xbox and that you could mod it, so i got it and had fun in multiplayer and some game modes Escape and TDM. Story is Still Sh*t with them having weyland yutani blamed for everything because they are too brain dead to think of a compelling narrative but the multiplayer can be fun, but since the matchmaking is broken there is basicly no reason to play it and if you see it on store shelves give it a pass.

With a funny story, cute characters and witty, tongue-in-cheek dialogue, it's very funny and definitley screenshot-worthy at times. It's also at a very low price, which is always nice.The only real downsides are the fact that it is SO short, and that fact that some achievements are hidden (cheeky) but this is a minor gripe, as there are many steam guides on them if you want them. I would recommend this to people who just want to have a casual game with the occasional laugh. :)+ Very funny+ A suprisingly interesting upgrade system- A bit too shortMy Score: 6.5/10",Runeraider,http://steamcommunity.com/id/Runeraider

Between the story, the beautiful graphics, music score, and the insanely enthralling card game mini-game, Final Fantasy VIII does the series proud. This is the RPG that proves if you got a great story and solid characters it can still be a damn good game despite some glaring flaws. This is the best and most memorable game i have ever played, and everybody who loves RPG games will without doubt love this game. First laid eyes on this game on my 11th birthday, my dad got me a ps1 and this game. Grew up playing it. This was the game that would spark my love of gaming and the rpg genre. You probably think that you can't trust my review since I'll be blinded by nostalgia but I played this game again recently and loved it. Played, loved and obssessed on it as a child. Played, loved and obssessed on it as a manchild.It has a good mix of humor and seriousness, the combat system works well.

I believe that we will begin to see many 4X games begin to use a similar model. Furthermore the species creator is very interesting, the implications of ethics and the political possibilities that they produce is just great. I do not know in what way that this game is worse than any other 4X game out at the moment. Masterful AdditionsTechnology - A genius idea of having there be 3 tech trees going at once, Science, Engineering, Social. So you are not waiting around for that 1 technology you are researching to drop, you have three techs on the go all at once. Loved that addition.Unit Builder - I thought that the ship building was actually better than Galactic Civ 3 even though it lacked the sheer customisability of GC3. I found my choices were more significant, and that the ships I was building were more meaningful to me because of it. Different Species - Oh the different species, and all of their lovely art, and differences. I loved that i can conqure a people who are better adapted to arctic planets and then just deport them off their lush contiental planets to the arctic planets i have not yet fully colonised, so that i can settle my more continentally adapted prime species onto it. I love all the different ethics, and i love how my peoples happiness is so effected by how i behave. ",stverbal,http://steamcommunity.com/id/stverbal

I took time looking for audio logs because the voice acting was so damn good. The gameplay was also great.

Audio is great, your radios will allow you to talk with the rest of your squad, however if you say something when an enemy is close, they can hear you also... The only improvement I would like to see is the ability to change the radio volume separately to the rest of the ""sound effects"" volume. Player voice chat is controlled seperately to sound effect volume.Differences to most shooters:1. Respawns. Depending on the mode, you will run out of respawns in different ways. Some maps give your team a limited number of respawns that you can replenish by capturing/destroying objectives. Other maps only will respawn your team when you capture or destroy an objective. Other maps you get given a limited number of respawns and can't replenish them. This makes the game MUCH more team-based, as by yourself you will die quickly2. Health. You don't regenerate it. You will often die from only one or two bullets, and you often have very little idea where you were shot from. This makes your individual tactical approach, as well as your teams strategy, much more important. If you run in the open, you die quickly. 3. Weapons. You get ""supplies"" which are used to purchase weapons and upgrades. You can fit different sights, ammunition, barrels, grips and accessories to weapons, you can purhase different types of armour and grenades.  You often need to balance what you want, as you don't have enough supplies to get the best of everything. Capturing objectives can give you more supplies.The only thing that I really dislike about the game is that there are some ""restricted areas"" where the game prevents you from being able to shoot. This is designed to keep you playing near the objectives, but sometimes can be painful as you cannot visually see where they start or finish, so sometimes you will run for cover and find yourself in an area that you can't defend yourself in.Overall a fun game with a steep learning curve and something I would recommend to any other FPS fan.",Delphaeus,http://steamcommunity.com/id/Delphaeus

Honestly I was glad I played it first. It made me appreciate 3 and New Vegas.  Not that FO4 is a bad game. Far from it. I have wasted many hours going into days of my life stuck in this world. Wanting to collect and see everything. First played on PS where i had two characters.  Now my hours are building up and loving every minute of it.  Playing the previous games made me wish they had kept the skill system. I really enjoyed that and the weapon repair system also.  This game is amazing.  It is very easy to get your moneys worth on this game..especially with MODS.  Oh mods.  Anyway this is a great open world game with plenty to do and see!

RPG elements mostly stripped out, SPECIAL and Perks reworked so every character feels generic. Charisma builds pointless, no path through the game for an evil character, weak dialogue. Landscape largely empty and same-y compared to earlier editions. Settlement building was a good idea, but execution is terrible here. Weakest game in the series by far. Haven't bought DLC but heard it's horrible. If this wasn't Bethesda, and a fallout game, I'd give it a 7. But against what these guys are capable of it's a 5.

39627,9 people found this review funny,332 of 384 people (86%) found this review helpful,226860,,"Posted May 19, 2015.","General features (can be viewed as pros):-Race customization is fairly detailed-Ship designer is good, even better because you can use pre-existing models and modify them to your own tastes-Certain resources are linked to certain celestial bodies eg antimatter surround black holes, elerium in nebulae, etc. So a savvy player, upon seeing a nebula knows to explore it fully incase there is elerium and that a black hole is likely to have some antimatter surrounding it. -powerful resources like antimatter are more limited, but using them is non-destructive so there wont be buyers remorse, ie you'll get the resource back if you destroy the building/ship that uses it. This also allows you to use resources early in buildings tech, and then recycle it when a better option arrives, meaning that a player who can manage his resources well will do better than one who just holds onto resources until a ""top tier"" usage for them is unlocked.-massive maps are possible, so with the right settings it doesnt feel like a ""small"" galaxy or that you're running out of space (until late game)-starbases used intelligently can give an edge at all points in the game, especially economic starbases. eg rather than waste a building slot on your planet to raise approval, just get the approval upgrade on the starbase linked to the planet.-able to finely control research/economy output/dedication on planets individually, but also with the ""govern"" tab you can do this en mass, saving time. Same applys for upgrading ships, etc.-every planet has an event, which some may find annoying, but I think is good, allows you do add a slight layer of uniqueness to each planet as well as develop your ideology.-its actually more beneficial long terms to dabble in all ideologies to some extent, as long as your primary ideology has most points you wont have an ideological shift. This means you dont have to do the unrealistic option (as in some games with ideologies/religions) and devote 100% to an ideology. This also means, if desired, you can play on the basis of the moral choices involved for events/planets and still do OK in terms of ideological benefit (as opposed to number crunching the statistical/numerical benefits for each choice planet, etc)Cons- diplomacy at first seems well developed, but that's only for early game. Late game diplomacy is at best, shallow, at worst, buggy. ""Benevolent"" ideologies seem to hate pragmatic ideologies as much as ""malevolent"" ideologies, which is silly and means that as a pragmatist, you need to kill anyone else who isn't a pragmatist and can only really form alliances with other pragmatists. This makes a diplomacy victory in a large game close to impossible without a decent military (because you need to kill anyone who refuses to ally with you), which means its always going to be predominantly a conquest based game.--continuing on for diplomacy: enemies will gladly colonise planets within starsystems you have partially colonized and there's no warning to tell them to â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ off (as in games like CIV 5), and the same for resources. Early game is basically en-mass resource grab if you dont want to be screwed over mid/late game.-pirates/barbarians in 4X games are normally some kind of great equalizer early game to prevent a military/expansion snowball (eg sins of a solar empire, civ, etc), but in this game they're just annoying and dont do much besides kill the occasional scout. also, AI dont appear to be bothered by pirates, so its just a player handicap.-once you start going balls to the walls crazy large military, the game will start glitching out your ""military power"" parameter, which means for the purposes of diplomacy, one turn later everyone will think you're the weakest, declare war/â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ with you even though you could wipe them out. this also contributes to the impossiblity of a diplomacy victory (without killing loads of people) -terraforming in the incorrect order can cost you between 1-3 tiles per planet, which is a fair amount. eg if you use a higher grade terraformer on a ""easy"" tile, you wont be able to terraform the ""harder"" tiles, as late game you can terraform as many ""easy"" tiles as you like, meaning its better long term to hold off on terraforming until you've researched it fully as it isnt always clear which tiles are ""easy"" or ""hard"".-money is weak, it can take anywhere between 5-15 turns to be able to afford to rush construction (pretty much the only use of money, besides upgrading your military ships) whereas focusing on manufacturing allows you to build anything in 1-3 turns. Basically as long as you break even with your economy, you can just focus on manufacturing and research. Its actually usually better to just decommission old ships and build news ones rather than upgrade them (which will make you bankrupt quick if you have a large army)---In other words with the diplomacy + economy balancing, there is no viable economy based strategy or peaceful based strategy. No matter what, you will always need the strongest military regardless of your intended method of victory (unlike some other 4X games, where you could have an adequate military and with good diplomacy/economy still obtain most victory types you desire). And basically to get the strongest military you need to focus on research and manufacturing.- united galaxies is but a shallow addition to the game, furthermore, if someone ever defies (which is almost always), they are permanently booted, which can lead to the ridiculous situation of having a united galaxy meeting of 2 members, while the other 6-10 races are ""defiant"" (yet have not formed another united galaxies).meh features:-culture. you must have decent culture to stop other races culture from ""flipping"" your planets, it also creates territorial space and (I think) it allows your ships to fly further into enemy space. problem is that if your culture is too strong it flips the planets of other races, including that of your allies. this makes your allies weaker and it entirely possible for them to be wiped off the map (further adding to the difficulty of a diplomacy victory). It also may land you a bunch of crap planets that you dont want to deal with. Fortunately you can give the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ planets to the minor races (who are immune to culture flipping)note: most of these issues dont apply to multiplayer games, this is predominantly a critique of single player. although culture flipping feature will suck when playing co-op with friends.Do I regret buying the game at full price? a bitam I enjoying the game? yesshould you buy this game full price? only if you plan to win/enjoy by conquest every time or if you only care about multiplayershould you buy this game on discount? yes, if it were at 25% discount it would be a good priceit should be noted that stardock have a good trackrecord for improving/patching their games post release, so I anticipate that some of these issues I have raised will be gone in the future.",serialies,http://steamcommunity.com/id/serialies

Grabbed the demo of the game, liked it, and finally bought this one for the full experience.Undertale may have a fair share of flaws (in which I suck at explaining so I'm not going to say anything about 'em to save my hide), but it is unique in its own right. Now, I might spoil you a little bit of backstory (or maybe a lot of backstory, but I'll try to keep it vague), but you play as the eighth (and last, depending on how you play the game) human who fell into the underground portion of a mountain (thus the game's namesake). You find out what's going on down there AND depending on your actions, you either save an entire civilization of monsters or doom them along with yourself.This game has a fresh take on role-playing game experience as it offers options other than outright killing anyone who stands in your way. You can choose to attack monsters in a battle OR spare them (Many monsters need to be interacted with before you can let them go, and sometimes this can be hard), or in-between. You will meet some important characters along the way, and whether they live through or die trying is up to you. Entirely. Undertale's system files REMEMBERS your actions throughout the game, and if you make the right choices, you will be lead to an ending that is satisfying (even if it's not for you, it certainly is for the characters). One wrong step though gives you a ""Pandora's Box"" effect. Remember the tale of Pandora and a box in her possession? This game basically applies the rules, ""Virtue brings fortune"" and ""Many will die for the sins of one"".If you haven't played this game yet, this may definitely be worth a try for you. That is, if RPGs are your thing. I don't know about you, but I have played this game and it gave me a mind-blowing experience.So what are you waiting for? If this game is your cup of tea, grab it. It's worth every US Dollar or whatever your native country's currency is (In my case, it's Malaysian Ringgit).",Anthemion,http://steamcommunity.com/id/Anthemion

After getting the game, it was fantastic. Looked beautiful (which is suprising for a game set in an apocalypse-like situation) but obviously graphic-wise it was and still is pretty stunning. Have played a fair amount of this game as you can see. The DLC called ""The Following"" was an excellent addition to the game however it really only added another 7 missions but at least it was in a whole new area with driveable vehicles. All the DLC together has added about another 100+ hours to my gameplay just by trying to do all the side missions, etc.Recommend this game to any zombie-thriller / survival fans out there. However once you play for about 25 hours it might start seeming a little boring and after the campaigns are done basically it felt to me like there was no worth anymore.Goodnight.

I bought the second season of TWD in may and after first episode i dropped it for a couple of months. I just finished it yesterday. Well, unfortunately this sequel is suffering from the same illness that AMC TWD series has. It started great in first season and each season is changing the show from survival show to soap opera. This game is suffering from this as well. It's not as thrilling as first season. Story is dull, boring, dialogs are uniteresting and in some cases scenes are too long and static like the one where characters talk by camp fire in Ep4. The characters, oh my. In sequel I found only one  character fairly interesting beside Clementine - it's Jane. Other characters are just lame. I didn't care about what would happen to them or if they die or not. This kind of Visual Novel (yes, its nothing more) at least should be based on good story and strong characters. But its not. Appart of lame characters, bad story, crappy dialogs there is not much game in game. You just don't play much. This sequel is based on ABSURD number of TERRIBLE QTEs. If you like hitting a keyboard key like  a frenzy monkey then go ahead play it. If not, then this game is going to be a torture for you. The choices in this game as in first season are simply just a detour to the linear story. In first season it was hidden much better, because the story was better. To show you how bad second season is I dare to say, that each short episodes of Season 1 DLC 400 days was MUCH more interesting than whole second season! What a shame that TellTale made this sequel. After finishing it I am not going to buy nex season if they make it at all. I do not believe this dev anymore and I am pretty sure, the will be pushing strong for their own DRM of which I am not a fan. So the final verdict. If you must have every game about Zombies buy it.If you are TWD fan, don't buy it.First season was imho 9/10400 days was decent 7/10Second season is well below average game, so:3/10. I DO NOT RECOMMEND this game to my big sadness :(.Edited: spelling errors. Sorry for that.",mda7,http://steamcommunity.com/id/mda7

You could see these features as the games way to pull you in, just like a good opening paragraph. This game is practically endless, but can have a completionist end. To ""complete"" Sakura Clicker, you have to basically get every possible spirit upgrade. Spirit upgrades are basically this games way of making you want to play it more. You get spirits by restarting the game. You can only restart after getting a certain way into the game, which is usually inbetween Zone 13 to 20, with 20 being basically the have to restart point early on in the game, because of how long it takes to kill anything. These spirits allow you to buy upgrades (which I am hoping will have a definite end, if not, I will be spending way longer than anticipated playing this time waster of a game), which give you buffs for when you start over, to make you feel overpowered, and progress through the game faster, slowly reaching to the point where you quit last time, and hopefully passing that point. Now do I like this game? Well yeah, and it's not for any idiotic reason, like enjoying the moaning sounds (I have had the game muted most of the time, so that I can do other stuff while it is left in the background), but it is generally because it is a good time waster. If you see this game as anything but a time waster, then you have generally suprised me. If I would have to critique the game, I would say that it had a hard time running it along side normal internet activities, without giving my computer lag issues. This isn't necessarily a problem, because I can close the game, and just check on it within however long I chose to leave it dorment in my Steam library. But despite this not really being a problem, I would love an option to get rid of these laggy features (I am guessing the money flying all over the place is the main culprit for lag).I will recommend this game, because it will continue to fill in the gaps of my bored, shut in life. If you have nothing better to do, get Sakura Clicker, it's not like scrolling down your Facebook newsfeed, or watching dumb Youtube videos, are in anyway better than clicking on big breasted Anime girls.",Katzieon,http://steamcommunity.com/id/Katzieon

One of which, winning a BAFTA (British Academy of Film and Television Arts) award. An incredible feat some might say!Gun Monkeys. Wellâ€¦, I can honestly say I never thought I was going to see those two words in the same sentence. At first glance, Iâ€™d thought a game like this was a little absurd, 2 monkeys fighting in an arena, with guns. Nevertheless, the lovely team at â€œSIZE FIVE Gamesâ€ sent me a couple of copies to hand around and spread the word (Thanks by the way!).Gun Monkeys is an intense, 2D side-scrolling, platform, and shooter. Gun Monkeys is basically a bunch of bad â™¥â™¥â™¥ monkeys, competing against each other in a 1-on-1 battlefield. Each player has one core, the objective is to maintain your core for as long as you can by returning little power cubes to your core, or (preferred option), annihilating your foes in the arena with an assortment of weapons! If you forget to maintain your core and the power runs out, then your opposition becomes the winner and will proudly shoot your little monkey brains out anytime, vice versa.My personal experience playing the game was quite pleasant besides the fact that I got absolutely demolished in every round I played. The controls were confusing at first but after a couple of rounds, you get used to it. Graphics wise, the game itself is quiteâ€¦ â€œtrippyâ€, as it features a lot of glowing colours and blurring, but this can be toned down in the options if you wish.   So, besides the oddly scaled matchmaking, I did enjoy jumping around the randomly generated arenaâ€™s, collecting different weapon crates and experimenting with the cool perks that the game allows you to purchase for your character. Overall, I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a couple of fast-paced, 1 on 1, combat/shooter, arena matches with their friends. If you are going to buy this game, might I recommend buying a second copy for a mate just in case, as the servers are not always filled with people to play against. If you canâ€™t find anyone online, the game also supports 2 players on the one keyboard for some local gaming. On a side note, the narrating of this game is hilarious!I hope you enjoyed reading my insight on Gun Monkeys, I had a blast playing it!Regards, Paul",Paulie1333,http://steamcommunity.com/id/Paulie1333

While it is similar to Skyrim in some aspects, a lot of the mechanics have changed, graphical styles are different, and there are many features in place to optimise the game for MMO gameplay.Warning: this game is highly addictive.

I will go ahead now and say I rather enjoy this game quite a bit, it's certainly got enough charm for a quick game every now and then but it doesn't have the lasting draw that most other RE games have. Resident Evil: Operation Raccoon City did some things right, but did quite a lot at a mediocre level and some things plain badly, so I'll tell you what i think, and you can decide for yourself.The Good -The Character design: The characters and most enemies in this game are quite varied in appearance and personality, and I like that. Mainly I'm talking about Wolf Pack here, they each have an interesting back-story that is never mentioned in-game (you'll need an external source like a wikia for that) and they all look unique and interesting. Personally if they were a little more developed I wouldn't mind seeing them in other games.-The Music: I'll say now regardless of how one-sided my opinion is, I love the music in the game. It's a mix of atmospheric tones to intense dramatic symphonies, all of them fit their respective situations perfectly.The Okay-The Cover mechanics: Cover in this game is a bit iffy, some things you can hide behind others you can't sometimes you can shoot from cover sometimes you can't. It's kinda like rolling the dice with your health and that's never a good thing.-The Combat mechanics: Combat is arguably the main aspect of RE:ORC, and when the main aspect of the game isn't the best part of the game, you're not in for a good time. Recoil feels almost non-existent but bullet spread is a pain to manage, especially with the less accurate weapons. The meele combat is okay, however performing executions and special moves is unresponsive and it usually takes multiple attempts to perform one.The Bad- Enemy design : Enemies in this game can be easily described with the term ""bullet sponge"". They all take a hell of a lot of ammo to kill and that's not helping the face you hardly have any to begin with. This isn't a problem when it comes to the slow and easy to deal with zombies, but when faced with enemy humans, hunters and lickers it becomes a huge problem and is even more apparent in the harder difficulties. Additionally shooting enemies hardly causes them to react, they just take it like nothing has happened most of the time which is frustrating when it comes to already hard to kill enemies like the hunters or the final boss depending on what choice you make.- The Story: Not much to say here, even for a spin off title in an alternate reality the story of this game is really weak and boring with no real development of characters.All in all, RE:ORC is a game that's fun with friends, but not worth the given price-tag. Give it a shot if you can ever get it cheaper but don't expect to be amazed by the game.",purpledragonfun,http://steamcommunity.com/id/purpledragonfun

Enigneer, Pilot and Captain.You don't actually play as them and all that but you do hear them talking alot and telling you when you're ready to jump.Things I would like to see in the future;Naming your ships so it feels more personal and you feel like you're your own unique flagship when everyone on your team is also a flagship.Increase flagship speed, a few times now i've joined a match, started to speed up and try to get into the zone where my team is and then the game ends because my team lost (again) It's not a super large problem but if it's just 3 minutes then I lose, I atleast want to spend that time getting into the combat and not trying to slowly fly into combat...ALSO I really hope they manage to increase the speed in when you ""log on"" and search for servers because so far it takes alooooooooong time and i just want to get into the game so plz Dev's work on that.Overall great game an I really hope it improves in the future.",CapSpook,http://steamcommunity.com/id/CapSpook

Well guess what! They have! The micro-transaction skins also give a stat boost, giving an unfair advantage to players that pay.Upon Payday: the heist's release it was hailed as one the best cooperative shooters/games in recent memory. The tight controls, intense firefights, brilliant music, interesting objectives and exciting teamplay all contributed to Payday's warm reception. Payday 2 Takes everything the first game did, throws it in a mulcher and uses said mulch to top its own list commendations with even more refined, badass action. Payday 2 Expands on everything the first Payday did right. Gunplay, maps/objectives, customisation, controls and music are all revamped for Payday 2 and with a large progression system, Payday 2 can make for hours of fun. My Score:If you liked Payday: The Heist, Buy this immediately.If you think you might like Payday 2, Buy this immediately.8/10 Pretty Damn good.",jarjarjake,http://steamcommunity.com/id/jarjarjake

This title is an experiment in exploration and survival, with each and every change being visible on the developer's Trello page so you know what is coming next. The game pits you, the lone survivor of a spacecraft crash on an entirely oceanic planet to try and survive against all odds. I will say now - for maximum enjoyment, do NOT look up or research the game's intricacies. Yes, I know most people - including myself - will often watch videos or vigorously devour a wiki's contents for information before purchase, but I can say with confidence that I avoided doing so with this title, and was pleasantly pleased (and continue to be). Learning what is what is a great part of Subnautica, and it feels...right, in a way.I can also recommend that if you have a fear of the ocean depths, and wish to overcome it somewhat, that this can help - it's rather therapeutic. As well as surviving the depths, this game features food and water (toggleable in game modes), base building, vehicle piloting and creation and voxel terraforming. Subnautica is yet another great title from Unknown Worlds, and I hope you give it a try.",deynarian,http://steamcommunity.com/id/deynarian

Each match is truly nerve-racking, with neither sharks nor divers ever truly given a huge advantage. The balance between sharks and humans is truly an amazing feat on the developer's part. Playing as a diver is terrifying; as your heart beats faster and louder in the game, the blood in your real body starts flowing, ready for action. There is a great level of reward that comes from winning a game through getting S.T.E.V.E back onto the boat.Sharks feel swift and powerful to play as, easily navigating and destroying the environment, along with any straggling divers.

D.R feels like a rallysprint but this also allows a few more people to complete events. The monthly challenges can be up to 2 hours long - That's a regular rally on a Saturday night for most real drivers.The game itself is graphically lovely, the physics are insane and show just how good Codies can make games.But nothing can replicate the amazing terror of throwing yourself through a dark forrest on a logging trail that was only driven on the last time you had a rally there. (and I'd love for Codies to come to Australia and make you sim racers have a go at some of our stages)This was plainly thrown together to get a CMR style title back into the mainstream press and now that it's released the 2nd game will most definitely be a WRC game with a car and stage list to make you think back to the old CMR days, Having some old oddities of cars would make a nice addition to the seemingly standard car list that lands in every rally game.Beast of a game that punishes you for mistakes.",76561198057982190,http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198057982190

Its a very good break away from grindy or shooter games, and allows you to sit back, relax and have a bit of fun piloting spaceships. The game always seems to have a sense of humor where ever you go, and the open world style of play is a nice change to linear storylines. The game also challenges you to think about what you're actually doing, but doesn't punish you too harshly for losing (destroying your ship, stranding your crew etc) compared to other games. The quicksave feature is also very nice.Overall, this game is a very nice change from almost every other game I have played, with very little ""grind"" elements, a good sense of humor and a nice open world system. The price is cheap, go and get it.10/10",nova_prime,http://steamcommunity.com/id/nova_prime

Praise the Sun!+In-game option to play offline. I like this.+Stats are more important. Attunement massively affects how many spells you can cast through FP. Physical stats increase physical resists, caster stats boost elemental resists. +Hybrid builds are weaker through lower damage, pures weaker through less adaptability. Choice and consequence. I like.+Along with real keyboard controls, special weapon attacks are easier to use.+If you are bad like me you will die again and again and rage quit. Then come back later for more.+More NPC's with more interesting stories.+Larger areas make exploration more fun.0 Armour cannot be upgraded. Not a + or -, but it means a lot of your resists come from stats.0 Game is not connected like DS2. The first real area is not physically connected to the start area, must use bonfire travel option.-If you are bad like me you will die again and again and rage quit. Then come back later for more.-Some FPS issues for me, though not major.-Still shows tutorial messages with console keys, but the keyboard settings map those to keyboard keys, making it easier to figure out what things do.Try tongue... but hole.EDIT: after finishing the game once, some new notes.This game heavily favours melee right now. Pyromancy is fairly strong, miracles are strong but you don't get a lot of spells until later in the game (best offence spell requires NG+, get it from killing final boss...). Overall sorcery is weakest and hindered most by the long cast times and subsequent low dps.

Cards have different rarities, the rarer, the more perks you have.Higher rarity also changes the cosmetics of your character, ie: different camo on clothing and weapons.Cards can be traded up for several cards of the same rarity plus a small amount of credits.Each character has 3 different primary and secondary and knives which you might get.Each character has different roles because of their weapons and equipment, and a different card (loadout) may change your playstyle because of the weapons or perks, etc.There are 2 mercs which are permanently unlocked, and some mercs you can play as or a limited time because of free-rotation, which cycles mercs every few weeks. You can permanently unlock Mercs with either ingame credits, or cash.This certainly isn't pay2win, because if you buy a merc, other people may be able to use it in a few weeks.It only takes about 6-10 hours of playtime to be able to afford a merc with ingame cash anyway.You can aim down sights, but it is not reccomended as there is nearly no (extreme) recoil, and it slows you down.Time to kill in this game is considerably long if you go for body shots, which is why headshots are always reccommended, as it's only 2-3 shots with an AR.Pros and Cons.Pros:-Attractive visuals-F2P, but buying things with cash does not give an unfair advantage-Accessible game with a high skill ceiling, easy to learn but hard to master-Free rotation mixes up gameplay-The game has ""under level 5"" servers for people new to the game-You're able to walljump twice and keep momentum, making awesome trick jumps and skill based movement possible-Gun play is great-Hitboxes seem fineNegatives:-Some maps and classes need tweaking, ie: longer cooldown for airstrikes-Lack of gamemodes and maps-The game requires a lot of communication and team work for your team to be successful.",1snap,http://steamcommunity.com/id/1snap

Also being able to heal from landing a combo is great - even if a fight is going badly, you are never completey out because you can be careful and land some healing combos to make a comeback.The setting is captivating and the voice acting and characterisation are good.

This is the best shooter game in my opinion, buy it and play with me and have fun :D. If you like playing story modes/campaigns then this is the game for you. You start off playing as the Grand Army Of The Republic, go through classical battles like Kashyyyk, when you fight a long side the wookies to destroy the Droid Army. After when you play as the Republic you now have turned to the Galactic Empire and fight againt the Rebels to have peace and justice in the galaxy. I won't spoil too much of the game because otherwise ou would probably won't play it because you know what it is about. Now the Multiplayer, Multiplayer is only on PC, I dont think it has multiplayer on the consoles. But anyways if you are the kind of person who likes to play online, then i recomend this game to you. in Multiplayer mode you are able to play as Jedi's/Sith if you get the most kills. Your able to fight in space battles which is pretty good.",Ranev,http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ranev

56372,,No ratings yet,286690,,Posted February 13.,"Metro. Catalogado como uno de los mejores juegos basados en libros, y no se equivocan, realmente muy bueno. La temÃ¡tica acerca de una guerra nuclear que ha dejado un mundo post-apocalÃ­ptico en donde algunos de los habitantes, -de lo que antes se conocÃ­a como Rusia- del Metro viven como personales normales en sus hogares, apesar de las pesadillas vivientes en la superficie.  Hasta que una amenaza conocida como los ""Oscuros"" acecha a tu estaciÃ³n-hogar. AllÃ­ es donde tÃº, el protagonista debes intervenir, para salvar lo que queda de tu ya deteriorada morada.El juego en sÃ­ cuenta con unas grÃ¡ficas buenas, para su aÃ±o de estreno y tambiÃ©n lo mismo en cuanto a la versiÃ³n ""Redux"" se refiere, la mÃºsica, y ese ambiente que hace querer ver bien por donde andas, pues puede estar oliendo tu miedo las criaturas de las tierras altas, la hace un shooter y survival horror imposible de perder. La variedad de armas que encontrarÃ¡s serÃ¡ fantÃ¡stica, desde una simple revolver hasta un potente lanzallamas. La opciÃ³n de ayudar o no a personas que, a lo largo del juego, necesitarÃ¡n una bala o un pequeÃ±o favor tras ayudarte a avanzar en tu camino hacÃ­a la ciudad de Polis, pero no creas que no te dan nada por eso, los puntos morales sirven para acumular un secretito. Inclusive, dos finales diferentes, que dependen de si has cumplido con el antes mencionado sistema moral podrÃ¡s ver el lado bueno de las personas que, en un principio, creÃ­as hÃ³stiles.Â¿Vale la pena comprarse el juego? Creo que de lo poco que he dicho debe ser buena razÃ³n para comprarlo. Estoy seguro que lo disfrutarÃ¡s, tiene logros que seguro te harÃ¡n pasar un rato o que tal vez cumplas a la mitad de la historia. Algunos cuestan trabajo, pero puedes repetir capÃ­tulos para completarlos todos. Puede ser que tenga sus dificultades como unos cuantos bugs que me encontrÃ© en la misiÃ³n ""Chocera"", y a veces puede crashearse, pero creo que no tendrÃ¡s problemas si por lo menos lo juegas en una PC de escritorio, pero si tienes una computadora gamer y deseas entretenerte por lo mÃ¡ximo unas... 25 horas (mÃ¡s lo acumulado con los logros) o 30 horas, es un juego que te va a dejar encantado, sobretodo con los mensajes que dejan algunos personajes como ""Khan""Reitero, no puedes perderte este juego traÃ­do de la mano de la novela ""Metro 2033"" de Dmitry Glukhovsky y el equipo de 4A Games.

The game is actually pretty fun when you get into it, its pretty rewarding too.Now I would usually leave tips for character creation up to people to find out but i do have 1 very important tip to write.speech is important but CHARISMA IS UTTERLY USELESS, I seriously recommed not having any more than 1-2 points in charisma, speech alone is enough, it sort of seems like charisma doesnt even affect speech in-game. Use the extra points for luck, intelligence or agility. (you really should start with around 9 agility, you can get an operation later in the game to increase it to 10, ability points are the most important thing in combat).for its time: 9.5/10for todays time: 8.5/10",6935,http://steamcommunity.com/id/6935

This game is one of my favourite from the Total War franchise due to being set in the 1800's which is really awesome as it allows you to play around and change the fate of the world. The stock game comes with a large amount of content which allows for quite an emersive experience from charging cavalry into the rear of a battalion of line infantry to firing a full broadside from the HMS Victory into a pirate vessel. This Real Time Strategy allows for so much and has the potential to look so beautiful on high graphics, it makes you feel like you are acctually in the game (well not really, but it still feels really good). Along with the DLC packages you get even more to think about like how much you want to spend to create one of the many special units or how to make a strategic army of native Americans. The AI is quite smart, it will try to flank you and will fall back and stay there (depending on the difficulty)if you have a really powerful large force but this game is best to play with friends against other people. The multiplayer (aswell as the singleplayer) has a large amount of maps and settings for weather and times (both period and day), and allows for up to 4v4 which can lead up to really epic battles on large preportions.This game is very good, some would say otherwise but in my opinion it is great and hope it is for you too.",76561198054397103,http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198054397103

Our senior officer provided immediate shock therapy through the use of defibrillation. As we were talking to the suspect about what we could to help her current position, she stopped us and asked us to remove her clothing as she was hot under her heavy clothes. We complied and removed her clothes. I being the gentleman that I am, noticed her lovely starry undies and complimented her on them. Within a second of receiving the compliment, shots were fired at us and our senior officer was dead. We made haste to the nearest cover and spotted 2 armed felons on the ridge to our north. We returned fire. In the rush of returning fire and adjusting positions, we noticed a group of three new spawns which we proceeded to yell at to â€˜run and take coverâ€™ as the firefight was escalating.  The assailants retreated into the dense tree line after shots were landed. Remembering that our late senior officer had a defibrillator, our youngest constable ran to the fresh corpse sitting alongside our still restrained drug addict. As our constable approached the body, the pumped up stoner jumped up and started assaulting constable with his fists. Constable swiftly retaliated with multiple swings of his fire axe. The poor addict was dead in seconds and the constable had no idea how to use a defib. As we gave up on reviving our fallen, a new spawn greeted us and asked if he could run with us for a while. So with a replacement for our senior officer and the 2 other new spawns already hunting down our attackers, we set off and up the hill to the red house. We made our way to the trees outside of the red house and were instantly greeted by gunfire from behind the brick wall. Bullets flew, missed and then hit our Luminescent jacket wearing officer, who had been unfortunate enough to be expelled from the tree we were squashed behind. Yellow jacket was unconscious. I fired back and presumably killed one of the thugs but one still remained. With no ammunition remaining and no other way to end the battle, I summoned the new spawns to my side, as constable and myself ran into the house brandishing our axes, ready for death. This was it. Live or Die. Smoke or Fry. As we climbed the stairs and opened the door, we took our last breath and breached the door, only to discover our enemy had combat logged.

It's like everything I could have a gripe with is optional, or not even a problem.Fines aren't horrible unless you deliberately try and rack them up. Parking a trailer can be a challenge, but you can skip it if you're low on time/can't be bothered. Worried about fatigue ruining the experience? Turn it off, sleep's for the weak anyway.The map is massive, the environment's lovely, and the controls are tight.On top of that, it's mod-friendly, and any traffic you back up from a prang won't scream obscenities about your mum.10/10.",sirzabblepants,http://steamcommunity.com/id/sirzabblepants

Survival is about a constant struggle to stay alive in a dangerous and uncertain environment, where the odds are most certainly stacked against you. And it is this essence which 7 Days to Die captures adequately and beautifully in the beginning, but which eventually diminishes and peters out due to the gameâ€™s lack of late-game content.Starting out in 7 Days to Die is hard, very hard. The game is similar to Minecraft, it has no storyline or  tutorial to guide you on what to do next. Instead, you are simply thrown in the middle of the world in your underpants, no tools, only a can of chili, a bottle of water, a bandage, and a torch to your name, and tasked to survive.  Juggling your character's various needs, and managing your daylight time properly are both essential components of a viable survival strategy. And it's what makes 7 Days to Die so compelling and stimulating to play. Because frankly speaking, you never quite have enough at the start. And depending on your luck, that undesirable state may persist for a few more in-game days. The Fun Pimps have rightly, in my opinion, made some of tools that are important, but not strictly necessary to survival in the beginning, difficult to obtain. And herein lies 7 Days to Dieâ€™s biggest problem. Because so much of its appeal is derived from putting its players in the seat of a survivor who never quite has enough to eat, drink, and is constantly struggling to stay alive against the odds which the game stacks heavily against them from the getgo, the lack of a forceful impetus to survive in the middle or later portion of a game, as oneâ€™s character gains in strength and survivability, ultimately and ironically detracts from that appeal. This weakness speaks more to 7 Days to Dieâ€™s apparent lack of late-game content than its heavy reliance on a relatively unsustainable premise such as survivability. At the moment, the game fully expects and encourages you to become stronger, but imposes no additional challenges to test your new-found strength. Zombies stay the same, develop no new capabilities, and although the game attempts to shake things up by throwing massive hordes of zombies at you every 7 in-game days or so, they are easily countered if you properly fortify your stronghold. I fully expect, and have faith, that The Fun Pimps will properly flesh out 7 Days to Die's content. At the moment, 7 Days to Die is still capable of offering its players many hours of deep and complex gameplay. I have only spent 50 hours playing it so far, and I believe I will continue to spend more time exploring, surviving and building in in 7 Days to Die. As an early access game, 7 Days to Die is definitely worth your money.",larrythebrony,http://steamcommunity.com/id/larrythebrony

There are so many new things to discover, it captures that feeling from when you first played Don't Starve, you're cold, hungry, afraid, and loving every minute of it.How Klei have adapted the base game for tropic based survival is ingenious, with tides, monsoons, tornadoes, a whole host of new foods and monsters, new weapons and inventive and aesthetically pleasing islands and biomes, all in the Tim Burton-esque style that captured our eyes in the base game.10/10 would surf away from a tigershark again",76561198065080939,http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198065080939

47741,,No ratings yet,339280,,"Posted May 2, 2015.","This is going to be a mixed review, however I will recommend it for EXPERIENCED or VETERAN MOBA players. If you are starting out in the MOBA scene, this is not really the game for you, sorry, it's simply just not polished enough for people beginning in the world of MOBA's.I don't have a whole lot of experience with this game so far, but I have clocked literal hundreds of hours on LoL and DotA 2, so I do have MOBA experience. Positives:- Personal Courier System: a really interesting idea that I think works well, and helps focus the combat on killing heroes and creeps/minions/brawlers (from now on will be referred to as brawlers), and not on looking out for couriers to earn some extra gold.- Recipe System: A really cool idea that allows you to change the components that make-up a recipe, thus giving you different stats, but still what the weapon is supposed to do.- Pets: Another interesting idea, that provides a little bonus for your hero, and aren't too overpowered or take away from the obverall experience- Last-Hit System: Playing and looking at the demo-videos of Strife it is obvious that they have purposely designed this MOBA to minimise toxicity between players, not only through community (Like LoL) but also through core game components and mechanics, I feel that this works really well, and benefits everyone.- Constant Stream of Heroes: This is both a positive, and a negative (which will be brought up later). Not much to be said, the more the merrier right?- Waiting for Loaders: When waiting for other loaders you are placed in the game. Your hero/champion cannot move, but they can level their chosen skill and purchase items from the shop. I like this as it makes waiting for others a little less boringNegatives:- Towers: I think every review has covered this, towers are horrendously overpowered. seriously. in League or DotA its possible to tower dive for about half a minute or so to secure an enemy kill, but in Strife, the moment you attack and enemy hero under their tower you are targeted (this is ok), but the towers hit like a truck. for the whole game. Fully levelled people are still scared of those damn things. This needs to be fixed. ASAP.- Constant Stream of Heroes: Unfortunately the constant stream of heroes is also a case of too many cooks spoiling the broth. With a large amount of new heroes, the ones already in the game cannot be refined fast enough, and there are some glaringly obvious heroes/champions with OP abilities and such.- Penalty for leaving: You can't play another game until the one you left is over. Yup. Thats it.There are probably a whole bunch of things that I've missed about this game, but on the whole I enjoy it as a refreshing take on the MOBA scene.Misc Things:- No AU servers: This obviously only affects AU players, but a constant ping of 200-300 is kinda annoying.- No all chat: I just can't find it, maybe it doesn't exist, probably due to the anti-toxic community take the team are going for.Overall, to conclude, I would say that this game is what it is. Early Access, BETA. Its a pretty cool and new take on MOBA, but its still early access, and needs some (or a lot of) work. If you enjoy MOBAs and know your way around them, give this one a shot, I think you'll like it for what it is. If you are new to MOBAs and are looking for one to start off with? Give this one a miss until you have more experience, simply because I think you'll have a better experience with other MOBA'sNow this is all my exerience with the game, with a measly 10 hours under my belt, thanks for reading guys-Glitch",glitchsteal,http://steamcommunity.com/id/glitchsteal

46590,3 people found this review funny,58 of 134 people (43%) found this review helpful,359870,Last edited May 13.,Posted May 13.,"TL;DR: There is currently an issue with FFXHD not flagging itself for use on a dedicated GPU in a system with switchable graphics. In addition to this, during my testing (unknowing running on the iGPU), the game has a tendency to crash when transitioning between areas. It's hard to say why, but regardless until these issues are resolved I'd suggest holding off. Users running into issues where FFXHD does not use their dedicated graphics are advised to manually run the executable and forcing the game to use the dedicated graphics in their system.## OVERVIEW AND MAJOR COMPLAINTSAt this point in time, Final Fantasy X/X-2 HD is a known quantity. You can read any review of the previous incarnations of FFXHD to know what the gameplay is like. FFX is a legendary PS2 title, pushing the barrier for graphical fidelity at the time.My biggest gripe so far is the tendency to crash. I've encountered issues where the renderer stops updating the display, causing the game to appear frozen but still be 'playable'. I believe this was an issue with my Intel graphics driver crashing, but haven't done enough testing to see if the issue is still present after a driver update. This could be linked to an issue I talk about in the performance section of this review.The far more common issue is a straight crash-to-desktop when transitioning between areas. It has happened twice during the first underwater segment, and again on Besaid after Wakka asks Tidus to join the blitzball tournament. This is a frustrating problem.## GRAPHICS AND PERFORMANCEThis PC release offers a variety of graphical options and improvements over the various console releases. While gameplay is locked to 30fps, menus appear to render at the refresh rate of your display (which for me is 60Hz). This might be a cause of concern for some, but personally while I'd prefer there be no framerate cap, a game like FFX is perfectly playable at 30fps.In terms of performance, I've been playing FFXHD on my laptop, hardware wise it's a ZenBook UX303LN with a dual-core Core i5-4210U @ 1.7 GHz, a 2GB GeForce 840M and 12GB of RAM. Currently, there appears to be an issue where FFXHD is flagged to run on the iGPU instead of the dGPU, meaning instead of using the GeForce 840M, FFXHD has been running on Intel HD Graphics 4400. This is my primary reason for not recommending this just yet, in addition to the crashes.Performance on the HD 4400 has been above expectations. The game runs at 1080p on the Low preset with textures on High at 30fps in most environments. Typical for integrated graphics, the framerate dips into the mid-20s in scenes with lots of lighting effects. Combat for the most part runs at 30fps (again depending on the environment), but attacks with lots of effects or explosions cause the framerate to tank fairly sharply. The GPU is given full license to clock up to 1,000 MHz with memory at 800 MHz and a temperature of around 73C-75C. I'm fairly impressed with these results given how limited the shader performance and memory bandwidth is on the HD 4400.As for performance on the GeForce 840M, the game runs at 1080p on the Medium preset with textures on High and anti-aliasing turned off. Exploring around the early areas of Besaid the game sticks to 30fps with GPU usage around 95%-98%. In a battle scene on Besaid, GPU usage drops to around 85%. The 840M is allowed to turbo to its full 1,124 MHz core speed and 900 MHz memory speed and temperatures sit at around 73C in my ZenBook UX303LN. Once again, I'm pleased with these results, given the 840M isn't exactly a gaming powerhouse.However, In reality I shouldn't even have to have two sections for performance. The game should be running on dedicated graphics in systems that have it. Whether this is an issue for Square Enix to resolve, or if Nvidia can resolve this with a driver update, it's still dissapppointing to see. Performance numbers across the board are better than I expected, so I see no isses with optimisation here, just the issue with GPU switching and crashes.## CONCLUSIONSThe issues outlined here form the basis of my decision to not recommend this game at this time. Crashing to the desktop is a frustrating experience, and users should not have to manually set a game to run on their dedicated graphics.However, when these issues are resolved, I will ammend this review and give FFXHD a solid recommendation. If you believe you're happy to work around these issues as they currently stand, by all means the game has my recommendation. But until they're resolved, this review ends without a recommendation from me.",SvDKILLSWITCH,http://steamcommunity.com/id/SvDKILLSWITCH

Yes, worse than tha oldschool Ghetto of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥znit Barrens chat son! I've now played mo' than 64 matches total & also completed every last muthaâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥in single hustlin mission n' I've witnessed not just tha other crew but even crewmates comin' at eachother & mah dirty â™¥â™¥â™¥ verbally before tha pimp selection even starts multiple times. I couldn't give a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥in shiznit if tha other crew trash talks sometimes yo, but up in a game where crewwork n' communication be a key ta ballin itz detrimenstrual fo' playas on tha same crew whoz â™¥â™¥â™¥ don't even know eachother ta abuse eachother fo' no reason. I aint talkin' bout chicken n' gravy â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. I don't even have enough ""reports"" left fo' dis week, fo'sho, they allot you a lil' small-â™¥â™¥â™¥ number of times you can report playas per week fo' bein punk â™¥â™¥â™¥ or detrimenstrual ta yo' crew, when up in fact you need nuff mo' ta report all tha â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ playas playin dis game.GOOD LUCK if you want phat communication n' crewmork, tha majoritizzle of tha time yo big-â™¥â™¥â™¥ booty is ghon be matched wit playas whoz â™¥â™¥â™¥ won't rap properly up in chat or won't work as a crew, you gonna gotta end up soloin every last muthaâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥in match since yo' crewmates is ghon be ""feeding"" enemy heroes or off bustin whoz â™¥â™¥â™¥ knows what tha â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ unless you have yo' own jam of playaz up in yo' faaaaaace!If you aint gots any playaz quein fo' matches wit you I suggest never pickin a support since you gonna NEED ta be soloin 1 vs 5, which is unfair as it is. But tha problems don't end there, since yo â™¥â™¥â™¥ is bustin all tha work yo' ""teammates"" will EXPECT you ta win tha game fo' them, n' if you take a thugged-out dirtnap they will verbally abuse you & report you or up in fact they might do it anyway just fo' funk at yo' expense!If you only chizzle up in tha options ta â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ wit Gangsta playas, don't be surprised if noone on yo' randomly selected crew but you speaks Gangsta!, instead it is ghon be Spanish, Turkish, Chinese, Russian & mo' biaaatch! They may even know Gangsta but just chizzle not ta drop a rhyme it, all tha while trash rappin' you up in they own natizzle language.Many times if you rap r crewmates which lane yo â™¥â™¥â™¥ is takin before tha match starts n' select it on tha map they will insist minutes afta tha match has started dat instead you do what tha â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ THEY want, fo' example they want you ta put a low on mana SUPPORT pimp by themself up in tha MIDDLE LANE.If you eva notice yo' crewmates ignorin tha chat or bustin thangs together dat may or may not be detrimenstrual ta ballin tha match itz cuz tha majoritizzle of tha time yo big-â™¥â™¥â™¥ booty is ghon be matched wit playas whoz â™¥â™¥â™¥ know eachother up in real game n' will only rap wit eachother OUTSIDE of tha game, whether by up in person, or voice communication software, instead of communicatin wit you as well inside tha game, so you gonna git NO IDEA what tha â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ they is planning.Also, fo' tha freshly smoked up playas readin dis review, do not expect ANY help fo' ANYTHING, like askin fo' lyrics or how tha â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ ta do suttin' from tha playas yo â™¥â™¥â™¥ is playin with, as you WILL be verbally played & reported (which is suttin' dat seems ta happen often up in dis game whether yo â™¥â™¥â™¥ is freshly smoked up or not) instead just fo' bein a freshly smoked up playa or any other wack reason, so I suggest bustin ALL tha hustlin missions before you do any real random matchmaking.All dat bein holla'd I do recommend (not highly) dis game afta all if yo â™¥â™¥â™¥ is playin it wit a crew of playaz & you ludd a highly competitizzle Multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) aka real-time game (ARTS) game or you simply wanna use its steam market.ORIGINAL REVEIW BY          Amâ¤          http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198099901747",H1DD3NT3RR0R,http://steamcommunity.com/id/H1DD3NT3RR0R

I would say that it's a bad game, mostly because it's trying to be a horror game and it isn't, it's extremely overpriced, the graphics range from okay to eye-bleedingly bad, has way too many bugs and the story is extremely hard to follow. BUT. Even though it really doesn't feel like a Resident Evil game, I'd hate to say it, but the co-op is sort of fun. I love how the game gives players different tasks and makes them get seperated and cover eachother. It just feels... interesting. Also, killing ememies is incredibly satisfying. Some of the boss battles are sort of cool, like the one on the second chapter of Chris 'n' Piers' campaign. Also, if you play it with a friend, laughing at the many broken things you find is awesome. So... I give this game a recommendation.",gooseisthegreatest,http://steamcommunity.com/id/gooseisthegreatest

The story is IMO the best in the series and even though I haven't played Ghosts I think the story from that game isn't even close. Zombies return and are still the same old thing which isn't bad at all (if it isn't fresh, doesn't mean it's rotten).

However it is in desperate need of a save feature ASAP. Its a bit anoying when you spend a long time building an awesome fort, just to lose it when you have to be taken away from the game. I also like the graphics setting for laptops, not that i will use it I like the effort put in to have it run on lower end systems. The only major issue is the motion blur.

The basic format is this; you have 5 item slots, your primary gun, a secondary gun, a thrown item, a major health item and a minor health item. You begin with very little, a basic pistol and a weak primary, usually either a shotgun or an uzi. You then fight your way past hordes of sprinting zombies to get to the checkpoint. Each campaign has several checkpoints, culminating in a final area which is usually the most insane part of the map, for example, you are in a rock arena fighting zombies on stage with guitars. Additionally, there are several special zombies who will make your day hard. They each incapacitate you in some way, meaning your fellow survivors have to rescue you.If you've read this far and are not interested, don't buy this game.

But don't even try if you cannot play this with a controller.   Dark Souls is tremendously challenging yet with the challenge comes the single most rewarding experience in any game. It is designed to allow you to play the game repeatedly (a feature I have never enjoyed in previous games but is perfect here), with different character builds. Verying builds change the game so much that you could keep playing it almost indefinitely without running out of something unique to experience and it is in these secondary, tertiary and further playthroughs where this game shines brighter than ever. Being able to carve your way through the bosses who previously had you stumped for days is an incredible feeling and reflects your skill progression. And that's the thing: This game is toted as being incredible hard (and I cannot deny that it is at times) but at the same time, it makes you so skilled at it that what was once impassable becomes easy (so long as you don't drop your guard!). You are given the tools to become incredibly skilled and your skill will make you feel better than in any other game.   It stands up as one of the most graphically beautiful games I have ever seen, complimented by a beautifully imaginative art style and character design.   Combat is absolutely perfect and controls are so tight that you will never feel cheated when you die; it can only ever be your fault ;).   The multiplayer isn't to be ignored and offers a tremendous amount of enjoyment for those brave enough to give it a shot.   The story is as deep as you choose to delve. If you don't care for it, you can ignore it completely and have a great time but buried within is some of the most intriguing lore you could ever find, if you dare look for it (look at youtube user VaatiVidya for more).   All this said, some elements of the port to PC aren't so great. *IMPORTANT* Don't even try if you don't have a controller to play this with. And DS suffers from some serious display issues which make the game unplayable for me, without the use of the mod DSfix (Seen here: http://blog.metaclassofnil.com/?tag=dsfix).   Despite some issues (which can easily be fixed) this is the single greatest game I have ever played and I cannot recommend it more to anyone who has a controller and the determination to take arms against this tremendous challenge.",drAlMac,http://steamcommunity.com/id/drAlMac

Use vehicles to charge the objectives and get people to repair that tank, charge into the warzone and get a medic to heal you and an assault to give you ammo!

You can play through a bunch of single player scenarios which subject you to taking down the odd bad guy, while knowing that a single stray bullet could end your life. These scenarios are all pretty much the same, move on to the next town, take out the five random guys that are wandering around armed with assault rifles, then repeat. It's multiplayer that makes this game shine, a bunch of modded servers like the immensely popular 'Altis Life' mode in which you can play as a civilian or cop. As a civilian you'll buy your drivers license, set off to a life of adventure, get robbed, stripped naked and kneecapped before being abandonded in the desert. In your next life you'll probably head over to the cocaine field to try and make some easy drug money, right? Wrong. As you fill your pockets with unprocessed cocaine (which look suspiciously like rotten cabbages) you'll likely run into a group of like-minded rebels who will make it their business to brutally kill you and take all of your items which you worked so hard for. Then you respawn with nothing and do it all again. As a cop you'll try to stop this from happening, but you'll probably just taze the wrong guy, run him over, then try to pretend like you never did it. You'll brutally murder a bunch of people completely on accident, that is to say, you pull a guy over for speeding, he annoys you so much that you shoot him with your tazer. Then he has a bad reaction to the tazer and the next thing you know you're cleaning up a dead body.Honestly, do I need to say anymore?",thomasonefoot,http://steamcommunity.com/id/thomasonefoot

The addition of two new playable factions, those being the Tau (Space commies with Mech suits and angry rooster people) and my personal favorite faction in all of 40k, The Necrons (Spooky scary skeleton robots), of course all the previous factions return with a new unit or two (Imperial guard get weapon teams, Chaos now lets you turn your lord into a daemon prince, etc)This game also adds a new between-battle map screen where you can upgrade your commader, train an honor guard, reniforce captured provinces and, of course, attack your enemy. Most of the battles are just basic multiplayer style skirmishs against the computer (with the exception of some missions that give you a space port or a daemons fury) but, in the heart of the enemy lines, there is a more mission based level, much like the previous games, that if you can conquer, that faction will be removed from the game, an you'll most likly get a wargear out of it too.Out of all the 40k games I have played, this is probably the best and most lore faithful (with the exception of the necron/human mix the Parias, they're gone now), sure it plays nothing like the table-top game, but lets be honest here. If it did play like 40k table top, the game would be alot slower and several hundred dollars more costly (But no less awsome)8.5/10",76561198045501641,http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198045501641

Dead Island has an array of features not only the brain dead zombies per se but also weapon crafting, somewhat open-world experience and at times, mowing down horde of zombies with a rusty car. It's a great game indeed and deserve the accolade as TMoZG. [As if that acronym exist] On the other hand, unlike the console platform, the PC platform does have it's flaws. In hindsight, the game does stutters due to poor optimization even with a GTX 760. But then again, that's about it. Oh, totally not for the weak-hearted.

If one character dies with a choice, the other just fits the role of the character that was lost. If someone else dies accidentally and you change the conditions for it, then someone else dies in almost exactly the same way. Very superficial choices, in the end, but the first play through was great due to the story alone.",zeroepix,http://steamcommunity.com/id/zeroepix

Do you realize how monumental this game was (and seemingly still is) to gamers and even to Valve themselves? Steam Achievement and later drop system along with hats were first introduced for TF2. I remember when hat phenomenon was all over the place and everyone wanted Fancy Fedora so much.Here is one fun story about the game; A guy from SourceOP known as Drunken F00l got VAC-banned for making idling tool for TF2 and for cheating an event item known as Golden Wrench. Including him, people who used idling tool got their hats and items taken away meanwhile all other active TF2 players were awarded with Halo hats for not using the tool. But after sometime the ban on the SourceOP guy was lifted and he officially started working at Valve for his TF2 Backpack and something more. Well, that guy had talent and Valve definitely knew about it so they decided to hire him in spite of all violations of user agreements as a Steam user. It reminds me of the FBI hiring a genius financial fraudster and there is even a movie about it. So much drama over TF2, aye? You see, this game just has so many interesting stories to tell.When TF2 switched to F2P model, the community even got bigger and stronger than ever before and it is still growing even after many years have passed. All official updates and endless user-created contents enrich the game; more drops, more hats, more weapons, more maps, more Halloween and holiday events, more updates, more everything, and now skins just like in CS:GO; OMG VOLVO. And its market is being sustained on its own economy. Quite amazing. I personally no longer play this game anymore because I already played enough of it, but it is easily understandable why this game is still one of the most played games on Steam..

Create your perfect hero or heroine and go off and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ as much â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ up as you can while helping children and the elderly to gather plants. Youâ€™ll lose your free time  and any remaining dignity  but itâ€™ll be a fun time. This game is worth a play especially if like me youâ€™re waiting for Black Desert to be fully released.  Thisâ€¦ Gameâ€¦. Almost failed a semester of University because I got addicted to it during the week of study before final exams.  10/10 worth it.  This game is amazing amounts of fun and itâ€™s free. Itâ€™s really solid for a free game and I like a lot of others must ended up buying something from the store. I have 4 characters and 3 of them at the level cap, I just got so addicted to playing this game.  Positives:    This game is free. Holy crap. I would encourage anyone to at least try it for that.  Despite constantly high ping the game played just fine for me.  Pretty much everything you can buy with real money can be bought with in game gold too so if you can afford to buy stuff in game you donâ€™t have to spend any IRL money.  I was able to create a guild called Westside Weeaboos and thatâ€™s the best thing ever.  want to be a cute elf girl?  I know I sure do. Heh.  Then this is it, create and customise your perfect doppelganger That looks nothing like the real you lol nerd   People are reasonably helpful and nice at least of PvE servers I played on. Sometimes you get some salty people when you party for end game dungeons though.   Negatives:    No servers outside of Europe and North America. I believe there used to be an Oceania server at one point but not anymore. Despite that though the game generally played very well.  A lot of busy work so things like fetch quests and kill this type quests. Which is something most MMOâ€™s suffer from.   I donâ€™t know if I like this or not but skill specialisations exist where you can only specialise in one thing at a time meaning you need to rely on guilds, market or friends to craft items to use in your specialisation.  Some launcher issues with the game.  (TL;DR/ Conclusion at the top)",37755753,http://steamcommunity.com/id/37755753

It was a solid team based FPS with an interesting variety of classes and many weapons and items for all of said classes. It seemed great. After a while of playing it, I have realised how boring it is.My problem is that really to have fun, you need to have lots of these weapons to add variety (because otherwise it is repetitive). The only problem is that you have to earn these weapons or trade for them - and by the time you've done all that (which is, again, repetitive and boring), you are tired of playing the game anyway because all you've done is sit around and trade or do the exact same thing over and over.Then there are the people that you may encounter in the servers:Mic-spammers.High-pitched annoying people (raging or asking to trade mostly).Spawn Campers.Etc.(But that stuff is usually on all games with a mic or whatever)I would recommend this game if I felt that you didn't  have to earn the fun rather than just get into the game and have fun right away. Pros: Well-done team-based gameplay.9 classes to choose from.Plenty of weapons, cosmetics.Still updated and maintained.Great art style.Haven't seen a single hacker. Cons: Earning items is a repetitive and boring task. (You are usually automatically considered a noob when you have no cosmetics)As mentioned above - the mic-spammers, etc.Trading or buying items is basically essential if you do not want to be called a noob or terrible.Quite a bit of the community I have are not the most kind people to new, unexperienced players.People seem to enjoy exploiting bugs/glitches.Too many people rage.They are essentially turning the game into a free-to-play crappy version of CS:GO.More cosmetics to have to not be considered a noob with the Gun Mettle update.On top of all those, there is the annoying ""don't kill me I am a X"" or ""don't kill me because I am doing X"" Then there is the abundance of fake youtubers and try-hards who ruin everything for everyone.It was fun for a while, but now it seems like a chore to play.",terrainer,http://steamcommunity.com/id/terrainer

You can build anything you want if you are a builder, or you can enjoy cool monster and boss fights if you like the dangerous side of the life (YAY). I've got over 1000 hours of gameplay on Terraria, like playing alone, editing custom maps and multiplayer co-op adventure or PVP. This game is awesome. With a awesome team working on its mechanics and sprites, and the great community that the game have, you'll feel like you're at home. I give a 10/10, cause it's completely awesome!PROS: - Boss fights!- Game biomes make it always different.- NPCs!- Every world is different.- +1000 ITEMS!CONS:- Finite worlds.- Don't have a story.- Don't have a local ""Creative Mode"" (you have to download a certain Mod)- Don't have QUESTS (actually there is a new Angler NPC who asks if you can catch certain type of fish, but I mean REAL quests, like the RPG ones)",fedalto,http://steamcommunity.com/id/fedalto

Worth every penny, more if you have friends to play with.Do not treat this like Star Craft or C&C - it is more like SupCom, minus base building and mindless ""super unit spam"" - you need to think about what you are doing.Graphics work on nearly any machine conceivable and cross platform. :)",famouse4,http://steamcommunity.com/id/famouse4

Gave it a good chance, but story is bland to say the least, loading screens every 2 min, getting into house is a nightmare with E button smashing on every window, come on developers, you gotta be sane making games, at least listen to fans of the series.  I am running back and forth in the same locations trying to hide from the same generic guards (mind you killing them and leaving the area makes them respawn). Then I just decide to run past them as I cant be bothered at this point, so he gets his weapon, swings and hits me from 10 meters away, how???? I am already 3 houses away from the guard at this point. Arghh, game is utter frustration. Only good thing is the graphics",76561198018912053,http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198018912053

The AI is woefully terrible, which I guess could be forgiven as they are zombies, however it just feels too easy on hard. I only played the first few levels, but the feel of the game just felt wrong. Like an unfinished game. There needs to be more fun rather than an endless stabbing zombies in the head simulator.If you are a fan of the series and want a Walking Dead experience then I would highly recommend you go and purchase the Telltale games series of The Walking Dead. They are brilliant pieces of storytelling that make you emote, and feel like you are actually making decisions that change the story. However if you wish for a FPS zombie shooting game then you should play something like the COD:Black Ops 1/2 Zombie mode.",FadedTemplar,http://steamcommunity.com/id/FadedTemplar

It is a speedrunner's dream, easy straightforward layout which you can lock and not have to worry too much about random generation. It also makes it easier for new players by not being as punishing as other roguelikes in the sense that it is ok if you die. It is, in fact, impossible to advance in the  game unless you die. This softens the disappointment of death and can take out the frustration if new to the game.

The story reveals more about what happened with the outbreak of the first game and introduces new zombies, survivors and a couple new weapons too. I think to appreciate this you will need to have played the first game though. The ending leaves you in anticipation of Dead Island 2 and overall, the game is enjoyable and worth a playthrough (better with friends).

This game is now literally paid to win as weapon skins, which can only be purchased with real money, provide stat boosts, as if DLCs that provide attachments that also provide stat boosts are not enough.Everything else is copied from Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, including the rarity, ""safes"", keys, and the 'Inspect Weapon' animation.Shame on you Overkill.Will NOT recommend.- StorylineThere is not much plot to PAYDAY 2, which is staged in Washington, DC and you are offered contracts by various key contractors who either request you help trasport narcotics, rob a bank, rob a big bank, rob a engine prototype or simply changing election results in favour of ""Four Men, All Votes"" instead of ""One Man, One Vote"". Community suggestions also led to introduction of new weapons and the break-out of a fellow heister who was sabotaged. However, some other extremely common community suggestions appear to be ignored or unaddressed.- GameplayThe heists are dynamic in a sense as camera placements, loot quantities and placements as well as guard routes can change every time the map is played, similar to that of Left 4 Dead 2. Different events can also happen for the same heist and pose a challenge to the players -- although some do get annoying at times and when you've played long enough, you'll become experienced enough to handle the same old variations.Some of the heists are also quite short-lived, as they can end as quickly as they were started and there are not much objectives in the heists, making the robberies highly repetitive and likely boring. A new friend of mine was shocked at the completion of the heist within 3 minutes. Newer heists such as The Big Bank Heist and Hoxton Breakout provide a quicker pace and a longer fight between the law enforcers and you -- but similarly it does not provide much variations. As such, the game has a balance of good and dull heists -- I had expected better seeing the awards though.There are four difficulties ranging from Normal to Death Wish, where Overkill would be the commonest difficulty when you're experienced and Death Wish would provide a truly engaging experience, unless you are stealthing and have not been caught. However, if you are new to the game, don't be eager to start in these high difficulties (although Normal difficulty is truly boring even for a low level).You can heist in Singleplayer mode, which limits you to yourself and 2 team AI bots, or you can play Multiplayer with 3 other players. The Singleplayer mode, which can be played offline, is annoying as Overkill reduced the number of bots from 3 to 2. Although the bots are tank on their own and can regenerate health and ammo, the bots lack skills and ability to help transport loot, making the player ""all on their own"" to carry out the goals. Bots can also be interrupted by law enforcers and makes it extremely annoying when they stop reviving you to fight back even when you're going to custody in a second or the revival would complete in a second. Bots are also essentially useless in stealth missions and all they do is to prepare in case the heist gets loud. In Multiplayer, things are more interesting and PAYDAY 2 mainly revolves around multiplayer as different user interactions definitely makes the heist experience a more unique one.Bugs are also common (to an extent) in PAYDAY 2. While some are fixed in the following few patches, others appear to be unresolved from day one till now.- GraphicsPlaying on 1920 x 1080 resolution, there has not been any major, gameplay-affecting pixelation yet and the lighting effects are not over-emphasised (which can cause the light bulbs to be brighter than the sun). The law enforcers' faces, especially the snipers, do look contorted though and probably can be improved. Some jagged edges are visible though unlikely to be noticed in normal gameplay. Graphic designs are however, in general, not neglected. Walls are vandalised with graffiti instead of being left blank, food menus in the cafe stores are actually filled up and paintings can be destroyed.That being said, the textures and details are often extremely blurred, such as the bank branding on ATM doors and food products. Even if you argue that the grafitti blurred out due to age, it's too blurred for any monitor with a resolution greater than 720p (or somewhere there). Although this game is a few years old, with the constant updates and huge game file size, you would think it has better graphics than the current, outdated one.- Character Feature(s)PAYDAY 2 follows system similar to that of RPG where there are 5 skill trees and several perk builds for you to choose from. You gain skill points upon leveling up and perk points upon receiving XP. Although more dynamic compared to PAYDAY 1 as every player will now have (slightly) different builds and thus different abilities (compared to a high level player which simply has everything), the grinding can get tedious once you have reached level 70+ or 80+. This has been more or less rectified with the XP changes and it has been much easier to level up since then.PAYDAY 2 also allows more customisation compared to PAYDAY 1, where you can customise the mask colour, pattern and texture instead of simply choosing the masks. This allows more than a few million combinations for masks to choose from (although some are downright unappealing). Masks are purely cosmetic and do not affect gameplay, other than showing your artistic sense.Weapons can also be customised using the limited range of weapon modifications, which can be extended via DLC to gain access to better or more flexible mods. Some mods are achievement-locked and require you to grind for them.- MusicThe soundtracks suits the gameplay rather well, tensing up when law enforcement assault starts and slowing down when it ends, giving an additional brief respite. Depending on the heist the soundtrack was based on, it can be classical music, a retro-styled music or even just ""exciting"" music that you can follow to. The soundtrack DLC is needed if you want the mp3 or FLAC files, which further allows you to customise your in-game soundtracks without the need to purchase other heist DLCs for the soundtrack. - PricingRefer to update.- VerdictAt its age, I would have expected more than DLC-locked content which are pumped out more often than free content (which wouldn't have mattered as much if the DLCs are more reasonably priced). Despite the potential in the game, I am upset that the game has evolved into one that is simply money-making without actual new content.We are not robbing banks, guys.

You have grown up in one of the many Vaults built by the government for what was thought to be protection against the war, but they where really built as a social experiment, with each vault being subjected to different experiments, from white noise to genetic mutations to never being allowed to open, all of which the inhabitants of these Vaults were unnaware of when they moved in.Now to the game its self. Fallout has pulled of the wasteland feel so well, from the survival to the ruins to all the strange and just down right wrong enemys you'll face. It has a great soundtrack based around the 50s-60s era which adds a strangely happy tone to the mood. The graphics are nothing special, but take into consideration how old it is. The weapons system just adds to the wasteland feel, with having to find ammo in the wasteland, and having to fix your weapons if the get to worn out. The most iconic part of this game is the armour, i mean just look at the game art, already you see a set of impressive armour, which just makes people to want it more.Alright lets wrap this up. Overall this game was groundbreaking when it came out, and to this day its still fun to return to the great DC ruins once more for another adventure, and isn't that what makes a game great? the ability to replay the game with the same enthusiasm as if you where playing it for your first time again.

34008,,3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful,310380,,Posted June 25.,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4uP1NHZSBzMFractured space os a MOBA that is currentaly free to play and it is in early access. It's developed and published by an Indie game creator Edge Case Games. I have played this game for around 15 hours and it is really fun.If you like giant space ships and MOBAs this game is the game for you.There is only one gamemode at the moment which is conquest. Your aim is to capture the enemy's front line of defense to unlock jump to there base. After awhile this thing called gamma is online. This can be captured and thus doing so gives you a attack boost. The maps in this game a quite boring as you fell like you're just playing the same map over and over again. Since the only change in senery is one of the astroids being made out of ice. This might be due to early access and I hope they add some othere maps in the future.Fractured space has no real story to it. But I think its cool how all the characters have their own story behind them and that if you click on them they play a cool little voice over. Its also fun as it looks like there is some sort of community behind fractured space. With overviews of different ships and all their ability's scattered across the web reafy to help you.The gameplay is pretty fun/ Each ship has there own set of abilities and loadout options that change some of the abilities. For example, The Venturer has a unique mining laser that can be shot with a stone mining missile which does no damage but opens up a hole in the shields for the laser to pass through for a powerfull combo.I found that when trying to engage in combat you get side tracked a lot and end up stupidly running into objects.Another negative thing is the player base. There is practically no one on and you find yourself waiting five minutes to join a match where every one DC's and the match is forfeited. But they recentally released a small arcade game your cane play whiles waiting for a match. But the player base will only rise once it gets out of early access.There are some skins in the game for your ship which and be brought with platinum and you can also purchase other dowloadable content which is probably most of there funding.Overall this is a solid game that I had the joy of playing. I found myself playing this game more than cs:go and I rate it three and a half stars out of five.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4uP1NHZSBzM",lekissecondmeme,http://steamcommunity.com/id/lekissecondmeme
47988,,No ratings yet,373180,,"Posted December 1, 2015.","This game is based on one of the greatest non-serious movies I have ever seen and is also one of the greatest games I have ever played. Gameplay breaks down into two buttons; left mouse (or arrow) and right mouse (or arrow), even though it is so simplistic, the execution is perfect. All you are doing is killing Nazi's with your fists but it gets more complex as you play for example, the most common enemy is a Nazi wearing a gas mask, they die in one hit so they are easy to kill. Next up is a Nazi with blonde hair, they take two hits instead of one. After that you have Nazi women - and once they are in the mix, â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ goes down - they take three hits to kill but, once you hit them they quickly teleport behind you meaning if you hit them from the right, they end up on your left ready to attack so, you must react quickly to hit them again by switching sides but, like I said before, they take three hits so, they will end up behind you again. After the women comes the Nazi Robots. They take four hits but, if you are not quick to destroy them, they will jump back and gang up with other enemies. There is no other strategy against them except to kill them as quickly as possible. The last enemy I have encountered is a Red Ninja and he is special because he is a robot and a woman combined meaning when you hit him, he will teleport behind you and on the second hit, he will jump back and gang up with other enemies.  The Red Ninja takes five hits and he kills me everytime I face him. In order to make this game more challenging, the developers added a health system for you, you have three hit points and no way to regenerate them (at least not from what I have seen). The entire point of this game is to get the highest score possible and it is a challenge to even get onto the leaderboard.

The ability to fly, ride bikes, drive tanks-Jeeps-and APC's in a WW2 setting is just great. You start off as a basic infantry soldier and from there, once at the right rank, can transfer to different classes (with a certain amount of in-game credits depending on the class) such as the pilot, recon, tank crewman and paratrooper (keeping in mind you can always change back to the infantry man). You unlock many weapons while playing and these include MG's, SMG's, Sniper rifles, Bolt Actions, Rocket Launchers, Anti-tank grenades/mines, Anti-personnel mines, Pistols and heaps more. You are also free to mod most guns for in-game credits. You also unlock many vehicles depending on the type of soldier you are. As a tank crewman, you unlock different tanks. As a recon, you can unlock motorbikes and Infantry Fighting Vehicles. As a pilot you (by default) get an aircraft. As a paratrooper you can't unlock any vehicles so far.  As infantry, you can unlock Jeeps, motorbikes and Armoured Personnel Carriers (APC's). These vehicles, if well driven, can be as fast as Sanic hte Hedjhag (500 fasts/h).

You play as The Nerevarine as prophesied to defeat the Dagoth Ur, who have tapped into the power of an artefact known as the Heart of Lorkhan in a bid to exert control over the inhabitants of Morrowind. This game is set predominantly on the island of Vvardenfell, just off the coast of Stonefall, in northern Morrowind.Any hardcore Elder Scrolls fan would instantly feel at home with the rich characterisation, role-playing elements, visual details, soundtrack and the quintessential open-world environment. It is still the best of all the Elder Scrolls games, because of the magnitude of the game for its time and the back-to-basics approach in role-playing - tremendous storyline, realistic characterisation, interaction and progression.There are weaknesses to this game however, the UI is not particularly helpful to meta-gamers (c.f. Oblivion min-maxing), the journal system whilst improved in the expansion, is still rather cumbersome to navigate, the inherent 'block' in combat can be difficult to get used to for some, as is the one-mouse-button attack and finally the graphics - this is a 2002 game, but thankfully the modding community has made graphic enhancement addons that could be easily installed and used with the game.Overall, this game is a gem.",76561198038741062,http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198038741062

11251,,1 of 1 people (100%) found this review helpful,238010,,"Posted February 2, 2014.","Deus Ex: Human Revolution is a great game. Why? Because it serves its purpose of making you choose how you'd like to play. From stealthing your way through a whole section, taking down badguys behind every corner, or going guns blazing- killing every one in sight; it's one of those games where choice is present. Although there may be choice, it does not affect your character or story (unfortunately). I played through this game twice and had fun playing it over again just to get the achievements. The game itself has a wonderful story; one that opens its way into the earlier Deus Ex games. There are plenty of easter eggs from the previous game to be found here since this is chronologically a prequel to the other Deus Ex games. It was definitely thrilling towards the end where different endings appeared. I saved it at the time to make sure I went across each ending and those endings gave the game justice. I couldn't stop the goosebumps from popping out.All in all, if there ever was a chance to get Deus Ex:HR - get it. Make sure it's the Director's Cut too because then you'd have the DLC (Missing Link) implemented in as well as for a few more added features. If not, just get the game regardless.",dravenk,http://steamcommunity.com/id/dravenk

They are usually clunky and under perform in every instance, but Ziggurat has blown that whole misconception out of the water. This nicely polished game has been developed by the independent team over at Milkystone studios and they have struck gold with the development of this title. Ziggurat came up out of the blue for me and I absolutely love that, being able to trawl through the steam store and finding gems like this is fantastic. With all the flaws steam has it redeems itself with creating a platform for indie developers to showcase their games. You take control of a character that possess different abilities which aid you through your adventure or disadvantage you in some cases. As with most rogue-like games the difficulty scales upwards when you venture deeper into the dungeon, enemies become more complex and you need to formulate strategies to progress or with WILL die. The game revolves around magic which makes for a great foundation for a rogue-like. Exploring deeper into the dungeon you find perks that enhance your character, examples include, increasing mana pools, health, damage or speed, finding secret rooms, sacrificing resource for luck or other resources.  The amount of customization of your character is endless which makes for amazing replayability. The levels are randomly generated like most rogue-like titles are. Venturing through these dungeons you can come across any number of rooms such as; labyrinths, trap rooms, secrets and other mysterious encounters. Finding secrets is one of the most thrilling things you can do in any rogue-like, but in Ziggurat finding secret rooms reward you with perks that are usually only obtainable through levelling up which just adds to the enjoyment or frustration when you eventually die and lose everything that you had. Ziggurat also has some puzzle and platforming elements which are actually integrated pretty well into the title. Discovering a lava room with some moving platforms makes the player realize that this game is not all about killing monsters and obtaining loot, but more of a mental challenge as well. Having enemies with depth and varied abilities is almost a staple in any great rogue-like game, this demands the player to tackle the room in different ways to counter the enemy types. No one play through will ever be the same due to this feature. Enemies range from murderous carrots all the way to giant blue blobs which will devour you if youâ€™re stupid enough to approach it. When entering the dungeon you are given a stock standard wand that does suffice for the first level or two, but the game really starts to get interesting when you need better weapons for the upcoming fights; so you desperately look in every last corner for weapons and spells that will make you so much stronger than you were before.  The mana pool is in 4 separate parts; purple, orange, blue and green. These colours represent what kind of damage is dished out by the different weapons that use the respective mana pool. MANA is depleted extremely fast which makes for some daring decisions to run head on into enemies to grab that extra mana that is needed for you to use your magic. The game looks amazing; the texture quality of pretty much everything has this kind of cartoony feel about it, but it also has a great feel and atmosphere towards it. The model design is quite good also, having many close encounters with the enemies you can see that the design quality is very high and this is something that usually falls behind when talking about FPS Rogue-likes, but Ziggurat pulls it off quite nicely. Finding loot is probably the most exciting part of the game. Finding items and perks for the first time always creates mystery to the run. Being able to apply different weapons to your strategy and rotation makes you play differently in every room. The weapons feel awesome, the weight and different specifications of each spell and weapon makes for a good time. If youâ€™re into FPS or rogue-like games you should definitely check out this title even if itâ€™s just for the innovation alone, you will not be disappointed. The mixture of great level design, graphics, sound quality and great loot really makes for a fun experience. ",Cybs,http://steamcommunity.com/id/Cybs

Also note that i am comparing this to AOE2. Okay so let me start with the plus's of this game.+Better Graphics+Bigger mapsThats just about all i can think of for plus's.When it comes to the minus's i'd like to think i have a fair comparison when looking back to aoe2 and this game. So this games ""RTS"" system is probably the most unqiue and bull â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ excuse for a game under the genre... The games AI is broken as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, the level up system is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing stupid and dont even get me started about the varity of teams. A small thing that made AOE2 unique was the randomised team names where in AOE3 it uses actual historyical figures to play as, all of which are terribly voiced over. I can't stress enough that this game is a watered down yet stale game.I cant recommend this AOE game because it hardly even stands up as an AOE.

15268,,3 of 12 people (25%) found this review helpful,359320,,Posted March 26.,"I actually find it rather difficult to recommend this game, even though it is one of my favourite games ever.And the reason why is the same thing you will hear in all of the serious reviews of the game. It lacks any significant depth.Let me start with the positives.    -The ships are amazing to fly. They all feel different and sound different, as well as look different and perform different.    -Combat is fun and balanced. It requires skills and patience, and is quite rewarding particularly when you manage to take down a larger ship.    -The sound design is absolutely amazing. Each ship sounds unique and all of the sound effects are absolutely superb.    -The game features an insanely in depth background simulation. In each of the hundreds of thousands of inhabited systems, numerous factions each have their own laws, affiliations and influence. A supply and demand based economy allows for dynamic variations in profitability, based on both the background simulation and player actions.    -The game has some of the best community involvement I've ever witnessed. Players influencing the economy has been a feature of many games, but in Elite the devs allow for player created lore-friendly news articles. Player created lore-friendly factions and political gameplay. Player run initiatives, and community goals which can be started and run by players. Elite has community involvement which legitimately shapes the galaxy around how the players act, and it really makes for some amazing opportunities.    -The game is beautiful and well optimised. I'm running it on a 6 year old laptop with a broken fan and I get smooth fps in almost every situation(excluding some planetary landings with Horizons)    -The game has a lot of freedom. Pretty much the only restriction that will limit what you can do will be your in game credits. Almost everything is available right from the start.This game also has a lot of negatives, however:    -To quote a video game reviewer Yahtzee-""A game where the player can do anything is a game that focusses on nothing."" Elite lacks depth. The trading mechanics are lackluster and basic. The combat, although fun, lacks much significant purpose and become very repetitive. Exploration is also something that gets quite repetitive quite quickly, and the way that the mechanics repeat themselves just ends up boring a lot of people.    -Missions are worthless and in some cases, broken. This is going to be fixed with Horizons patch 2.1 hopefully, but as it stands missions often do little to increase someone's balance.    -The game is horrifically bad at explaining almost all of the mechanics. The first tutorial essentially tells you that left click = fire weapons and then ends. I have had this game for many months now and I am still learning about how some of the most basic mechanics actually work, and that was because I have done a lot of research into how to do things in the game.Overall, I personally love Elite Dangerous, but many people find that it is boring or much too difficult or unfinished. And I think these claims are justified. I would say that it takes a certain type of person to enjoy Elite, particularly in its current state. If you are the type of person who is able to self motivate yourself to participate in the galaxy as if you were actually living in it then I absolutely must recommend this game. If you are the type of person who wants a game for casual fun, then I don't recommend buying the full game, perhaps just buy Arena instead.",obeseninja27,http://steamcommunity.com/id/obeseninja27

Instead of small servers with about 20-30 people, Planeside 2 has 4 HUGE SERVERS, like 500-600 people on at any given time. It is a great game, due to the fact that it is very huge and has many areas for large battles to take place in. Sadly, although there is many places capable to support huge battles, rarely do these areas actually see fighting. Most fights are skirmishes between 12-24 people to take or retake an outpost. The launch trailer shows this game as a game which is about a gruesome war. However, in game the graphics and the environment have bright colours and beautiful landscapes. All that hype of a war zone is gone. In fact, the landscape hardly shows any sign of warfare. Taking outposts is fairly boring and pointless, only allowing the next outpost to be taken. Only large outposts like Amp Stations and Bio Labs have strategic value. Adding more value to outposts and increasing the sense that the players actions have effects on the world and the war would improve the game a lot. 7/10",76561198054743531,http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198054743531

No crashes, or bugs seen as yet. The game is what I was expecting, and I am enjoying it thus far. I don't really like these micro transaction shops that a lot of games are using, but eh I don't have to spend the money there if I don't want to, so I expect that these systems will be common place in games, so I fell that this is not a point for giving the game a thumbs up/down. I don't like this DLC being tired to a save idea but that will most likely change given the upset of alot of customers. Being day one perhaps its worth waiting a bit for more optimising before refunding, from what I have seen the game play and story are what I had hoped for. I realise I have only spent a few hours in game so far but I will give it a thumbs up for now. Will update this review at a later time.Addit: Played on my desktop system with nil issues also. Yes not at full noise, but I run a higher res monitor and the recommended specs suggest a Gtx 970 at 1080 at high presets (I belive). Game looks good and plays well, enjoying it.P.S running 364.72 driver (28/3/16).

Watch dogs brings a lot of new and interesting ideas to the table but also has a lot of things that can become annoying after a while. Like the story. At first i really liked the story, but by the end i feel like the Devs just threw everything at the wall to see what stuck and along with that they sequal bait so hard its so ridiculous. Even throughout the game, only a few characters are really interesting, making the story lacking at bestThe gameplay is basically GTA but with a hacking twist. Basically you may use the hacking ability to manipulate the world around you leading to some interesting car chases between the cops. After a while though, the hacking becomes repetative from riding the cameras to just doing basic hacking things. The covers system is also annoying because when i need to get out of cover quickly, My character has a resistance to leave. This is due to the cover latching system. For when your get into cover Aiden latches onto it. Also the game is very short and most of the missions arent very variedThe graphics are okay. While the lighting effects are very good, the rest of the games graphics kinda meld together into a mesh of bland colors and basic texturesWhile the graphics arent terrible they arent worth celebrating.Also the vigilante system is a total pain. If your reputation decreases too much the cops start constantly harassing you meaning that you cant really go on massive killingSprees without the reputation system â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing you over. Money is very easy to aquire and doesnt really have a need to worry about your cash supplies. All in all, watch dogs isnt very good. But it isnt the worst game ever. The profiler is very interesting, the gun combat is very good, and while i did complain about the vigilantesystem it does offer a different aproach to combat. But then the game throws bad design choices at you that ruin your gameplay experience. As i said at the begginning of the review, if there was a meh rating i would choose it.",76561197963469414,http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197963469414

It is my favourite game series of all time and I was undescribably hyped for this game. As of now, I cannot recommend it. Although my PC isn't the best, I get a decent amount of frames which do make the game playable but that would make it a positive review, right? The game is bugged. It is in a bad, unstable state and needs to be patched. Currently, I cannot attack enemies and they cannot attack me. I can walk through them as if they were not there. I really hoped this wouldn't continue, but I cannot progress through the game. Many of my friends with good PC's also complained about the extremely long start-up times and FPS issues. However, from my point of view I cannot play the game. This review warns people of the bug and I hope this issue is fixed as I am desperate to play this game.EDIT: Discovered the only way I can be attacked or enemies can be attacked is if you strike their initial spawn location. Still makes the game unplayable.",76561198028390064,http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198028390064

Well, you're in luck because they had sex and produced the two-headed, roguelike love child that is Convoy.The game is set on a post-apocalyptic world where 80's and 90's film and television references pepper the skies. Your ship has crash landed and you're tasked with finding replacement parts to get the old girl flying again. This puts you in charge of the MCV and two combat vehicles, making up your convoy. Your convoy crawls across the map chasing down leads and getting into trouble. You can upgrade your vehicles with new weapons and equipment and even purchase more vehicles to add to your convoy. You must protect your MCV at all costs, for once it's destroyed the game is over.When you get right down to it, Convoy plays very much like FTL. The difference is Convoy gives you more tools to help you determine your fate. You can manoeuvre your vehicles into cover or out of the range of your enemy's guns, spend extra fuel to escape ambushes you don't think you can win and you can track down a camp at any time outside of combat in order to repair and refuel. This doesn't mean the game is easy by any stretch of the imagination, over confidence is the biggest killer out in the wasteland and sometimes you'll find yourself in situations where you just can't avoid losing one of your vehicles. All in all, the best weapon you have in Convoy is being prepared.The GoodYou're presented with a lot of options throughout your travels. Maybe one of the factions hires you to transport a crate for them. Will you deliver it no questions asked or look inside? It turns out the crate is holding a shipment of undernourished slaves. Will you set them free, make them work in your convoy or put them back in the crate and sell them on the black market. All options are viable and not at all bound to a linear morality system. The choice is entirely yours to be noble, pragmatic or sinister. Furthermore, almost all interactions with NPC's allow you to shoot first and ask questions later or not ask questions at all. This is really where Convoy shines, its no-holes-bared willingness to let you be a complete and utter d@#k to everyone around you.Bosses take the form of enemy MCV's or giant flying machines of death. So long as you make liberal use of the pause button, though, the boss fights arenâ€™t infuriatingly difficult, you always feel like you have a chance. But if you're not prepared and the enemy starts attacking your MVC on low health it's all over.As stated above, Convoy is littered with film and television references. While some might find it cheese or cheap, I personally enjoy that style of writing a great deal. It's a game that wears its influences on its sleeve and, as a fan of those influences, I'm A-ok with that.The BadThe game has bugs. Nothing game-breaking, but it is a nuisance nonetheless. Sometimes the UI will freak out and overlap on itself or if your MCV is destroyed a moment after you defeat an enemy the game will keep going even though you can't actually do anything without the MCV. Restarting the game seems to fix these issues, but it is a mark against the overall polish of the game.What You Need To KnowBugs, bugs, bugs...There are a lot of customisation options for your vehicles. Different guns do different things and fire in different ways and with different arcs and line of sight requirements. You can even turn your MCV into a glorious, throbbing weapons platform of death!More MCV and side vehicle options and variants can be unlocked by reaching certain milestones in the game.The game can get quite dark in places, especially if you're selling slaves or shooting innocent people. Something to be wary of, if you're soft and sensitive.ConclusionAll that being said, I've had a lot fun with Convoy. It's a great concept and I'm thrilled that games like this are being made.If you enjoyed FTL and like the idea of that concept being translated to ground vehicles, or if you're a Mad Max junkie and you enjoy tactical roguelikes, you might want to have a look at Convoy.As the bugs aren't game-breaking I have no problem recommending the game, but do keep in mind that you are likely to come across annoying little hiccups here and there. So, if that kind of thing really bothers you, you might want to wait until they're patched out before buying the game.For more reviews, gameplay videos and shenanigans visit  The Roleplay Gamer  YouTube channel.",theroleplaygamer,http://steamcommunity.com/id/theroleplaygamer

4076,,No ratings yet,440,Last edited March 29.,Posted March 29.,"Team Fortress 2 is a game that has been around for years, and certainly hasn't died down in terms of popularity. Almost everyone has heard of this game, either by it's proper title or as it's more commonly referred to as ""Hat Simulator 2"". The game in it's form is simple; kill and don't be killed. The question you are probably asking yourself is: should I get it? Well, let's go through some of the pros and cons before making a decision.Pros: -It's Free-To-Play, it (initially) costs nothing. -Nine unique classes to choose from. -Over seven different gamemodes (CTF, KoTH, etc.). -Over seventeen different maps. -Mod support for player made content (e.g. PropHunt) -Over 100+ items (cosmetics, weapons, and more)Cons: -Earning cosmetics is a rarity, microtransactions are faster. -Hackers galore (beware ""get gud, get lmao-box"" and other stuff like that). -Constant updates that alter weapon statsThis game is one of the best our there, well, one of the best Free-To-Play games that is. You'll find yourself spending hours on a server trying to kill the guy dominating you, trying to unlock new weapons, and trying so desperately to master rocket-jumping. So, if fast-paced multiplayer games are your cup of tea, then I recommend you give this a download.Team Fortress 2 = 10/10",MortemSpiritus,http://steamcommunity.com/id/MortemSpiritus

The Darkness 2 follows the story Jackie Estacado a mob boss who inherits a peculiar ability which is wielding the Darkness. The game uses cell shading similar to borderlands which compliments the game world well. The gameplay is quite original and lets you â€œquad-wieldâ€ which basically means you can wield a gun in each hand while also controlling your two darkness demon arms. The controls feel a bit fiddly when using a mouse and keyboard, if you own a controller I would recommend using that instead. This game has some of the most gruesome kills I have ever seen in a game. Using your demonic arms you can rip your enemies in half, slice of their head or even pull out an enemyâ€™s spine from his butt the list goes on. The single player campaign took me about 6 hours on my first play through and left me wanting more, not because the game was bad but because it was so darn good. There is also a co-op campaign which was fun to play with friends but got boring very quickly. In summary, I really enjoyed this game and its unique gameplay but found it was bit to short.",PhlyQ,http://steamcommunity.com/id/PhlyQ

(I reccomend setting it to low or medium) Zombie AI is somewhat okay and the zombies will react to the player or any noise that is in their range, in other words: They can't see you, they can't eat you, just don't be too loud. Next, homes sites you find and move too have different pros and cons, like an area closer to supplies or an iscolated place far away from zombies. You can interact with survivors to either scout for supplies or accompany you. Otherwise, a great game with awesome features,7.5/10 at best",gamerman3828,http://steamcommunity.com/id/gamerman3828

32608,,No ratings yet,305620,,Posted January 17.,"I really loved the atmosphere of this game. The graphics were great, I loved the snow! It runs really well on my late 2009 iMac at default settings. There was a lot I liked in the game. It really gave a sense of loneliness and desolation as you were wandering around exploring the area. I'm recommending it, as its actually quite beautiful and the potential is there for a fantastic game!That said, there were some issues. Exploration. The novelty quickly wore off. After playing for a couple of hours walking around became tedious. Its so slow. Painfully slow. It made me NOT want to explore and I love exploring! I get it, its cold and the cold/snow would make me slow down. And add to that, if you're carrying too much... you slow down even more. And it is so easy to carry too much. The game gives you that sense of ""keep all the things!"" because you need to survive right? But you can't carry enough to keep everything you find. I found at times I was ditching good food just to pick up something else that was good that I could use. So many times I was just carrying way too much and getting slowed down so much. But even just walking around with your clothes and minimal essentials felt too slow. I'm not wanting to run everywhere or fast travel or anything. Just walking at a good pace would be nice.  The biggest issue though, was that after a few hours I felt like there wasn't much left to do. Sure, I could slowly walk over there and explore that hut and find more stuff I already had. I could explore that area over there but I do and there is nothing there to really see. And then what? I have enough food for a while thanks to some fishing hooks and what I've found looting, I have a fire going in a house I found, so I'm warm with lots wood that I have dragged back to the house. I'm wearing warm clothes (and haven't found anything warmer). I'm melting snow for water so I might get thirsty but I'm not going to die of thirst. There's a big warm bed I can sleep in. I'm only on day 8 or 9 and what now? I don't feel there is enough to keep me playing to earn that ""survived 200 days"" achievement right now. But I do know this game is Early Access. The game isn't finished. So hopefully when I come back to this game (and I will come back to this game) there will be lots more to do! Because I want to love this game. I do like what is there so far.  I can't wait to see how the game grows.",starfleetbrat,http://steamcommunity.com/id/starfleetbrat
31381,,No ratings yet,22370,"Last edited January 25, 2014.","Posted January 25, 2014.","This game is outright awful. Its major problem is that it is purely an RPG, merely with a FPS perspective (and while RPGs typically boil down to stat designation to compensate for not having any gameplay- a FPS game has no excuse, especially when other FPS like FarCry 3 mix RPG elements perfectly fine). -Interface is clumsy-Skills system is awful- instead of simply enhancing your proficiency or giving you new, handy abilities (like FC3), it simply unlocks arbitrary ""XX minimum skill level required before you are allowed to do this task"" restrictions. And the only way to level up is to hunt down hundreds of enemies, it seems. Also, you get very poor information as to what leveling up otherwise does for you-Weapons are clumsy and weak. A fake 'ironsights' mechanic doesn't help.-Enemies are boring and scarce-Exploration is a chore as everything is so far apart with no faster way of travelling to new areas than walking slowly to them-You want to avoid collecting items as they make you heavier, and you're not allowed to fast-travel for some reason, forcing you to open up your options menu and manually take out dozens of items until your weight gets back into the green-Lots of bugs and glitches- game crashed a few times, and that part where the bad guy shoots the sheriff? Apparently I was supposed to sit back and watch, as punching him causes the sheriff to shoot me instead, ignoring the other guy.-Tutorials are obscene- typically FPSs presume you already know how to walk and hit the 'e' key, but presume you don't know the more advanced mechanics like how 'stealing' works, Karma works, is there a consequence for shooting drones or picking up too many objects, how radiation poisoning works. Not this game, instead it spends 30 or so minutes dragging us through the obvious mechanics, and expects the player to figure the rest for themselves.I don't recommend even playing it. I wish I actually didn't.",76561197982685987,http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197982685987

The character customizeation proves to help you make a unique character and vehicle.But there some downsides in which i should mention...1. No sign of australian servers. Im from Sydney, so that means playing on a US server is like playing with alot of viruses in your pc. and i mean ALOT.2. AIs. Yes, the AIs are â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, like. Very Very â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. But really, the fun youll be getting out of this is the players. Which is another problem.3. Players. There really isn't alot of people on the servers, Exept for like, one US server. The rest of the servers are â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing empty nearly, i saw a server with 4 people on. Get this is mind, one server PER country, no, one server IN US AND BRAZIL.4. P2W. Or Pay to Win. Lets get this straight. I, â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing, Hate, pay to win games. Sure, it can be fun to play f2p games, but when it comes to that point when you keep getting killed by the same noob who bought a shotgun for 10 dollars. Its just not fair. I have no problem with pay to win games like planetside 2, because the stock weapons are newbie-friendly. But the stock weapons on APB reloaded is just, No...5. Car mechanics. Oh god where do i begin? You know those frustrating Ice physics you see in games? Its sort of like that. but this time, you driving a car on an ice-skating rink painted black and white with a bit of yellow. Its that bad, like REALLY bad. IDk if its just ther server problems i mentioned earlier or just a bug the developers cant be â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed fixing.Overall, these are just badsides, the customizeations is something deffinately worth playing this game for.i'd say 5/10.

The cars are awesome, subtle little changes compared to originals gives them their own style without changing the character. The maps are quite big and use a lot of vertical space, kind of like Maim Street in Carma 2. There's a good mix of old and new powerups too.Most of the complaints are about frame rate and load times so I'll address those directly:The load times are pretty huge, it does take 30-40 seconds to load a map, sometimes a bit longer.I don't have any issues once it's loaded with SLI GTX 670s and an i5 CPU running at 4ghz but my HTPC that runs Grid 2 beautifully is a slide show (1-2 fps) so I guess it's a bit hit and miss.My only complaint is how it feels like all the cars have the oiled up tyres debuff. Seriously, make a turn at ~60kph and you slide into a wall. It makes exploring the tight maps and checkpoint stampede really frustrating because it feels like you're steering a boat. I'm sure it'll improve with the handling upgrades but that's a long way off in the campaign. Also the engine sounds get really annoying really quickly (I changed the engine sounds in Carma 2 to an actual V8 and it sounded f*cking amazing).It's not the kind of game I can play for hours at a time, but it's awesome for a quick 30 minute destress every now and then :)",badminton,http://steamcommunity.com/id/badminton

The Adult level is bland and your constantly pushed by people you make your way towards your crappy office job. The Old guy level was really bland and fuzzy you were also slow and you and to stop hallway through the street because you were â€˜tiredâ€™. You also had to restart the level if you got run over by cars which I think is a reference to dumb old people who cross the road when cars havenâ€™t stopped.However the level that really hit me the most was the child level. Unlike the other levels which were black and white this level was colourful. You had to cross a bridge to candy land while dragons tried to push you off into lava pit.This game made me realise that childhood is a gift and is the best years of your life.,Deus_VuIt,http://steamcommunity.com/id/Deus_VuIt

(Don't listen to those who complain melee is too overpowered, it is very easy to counter with the right weaponry and with enough practice)Con's:*The inventory whipe kind of killed it for me, I had spent a long time obtaining my items and while they said that they made all cosmetics/items craftable, some of my favourites are actually not craftable, such as the harvest sickles and the pumpkin grenades.*Australian's may have a hard time playing as the player hosted servers can get quite lag, but its usually not unbearable.*Last I checked the co-op survival mode, I believe it was called Horde mode or something, was currently not working, which sucks because it used to be very fun.While the cons I've listed may seem to outweigh the pro's, this is really not the case. Minimum is a very fun game and I can't wait till it's completely restored to its former glory :)Minimum was one of my favourite games.However I would not recommend buying it (not that you can) in it's current state due to:#1 (This is the most important issue) The servers have been down for what seems like an eternity, you cannot actually play the game should you buy it![/b]#2 Prior to the server issues the new developers did not release that much new content. They redid some maps and released a couple new maps, but didn't add any new weapons or armour. (Not that the old developer were any better, as prior to the new developers taking ownership of the game they had not released anything new for quite some time). The last content update I remember was an april fools joke! When they added an invisible weapon and armour (the promo for said armour looked awesome, shame they didn't just make that armour)#3 Prior to the server issues the community was very small. Quite often you'd end up being put on a server with bots rather than one of the few servers with people on them. This was not always the case, as the community used to be huge before the old devs stopped making new content.Minimum was an amazing game and should they fix all the problems and actually bring the servers back online and start releasing new content (it would be a lot easier if they just hosted directly through steam like some other games) then go ahead and buy it, you won't regret it.

Its custimization feature is nothing compared to 2K14, it has 1 nice new feature, but that would basically be it. In 2K14 you have alot more custimizations available, more masks/clothing. You can edit the face more, more hair/facial hair.But anyways thats not what the game is about, so I think this game is actually pretty good besides those exceptions, just one more feature which I think they shouldve added is the arena music effect they used in 2K14. It made you feel like you were there with all the echos, but yeah thats basically it, I would rate this 7 and a half outta 10.",jokasavage,http://steamcommunity.com/id/jokasavage

Also the AI spams RPGs constantly which often times wipes out your entire team before a single bullet is shot. Enemy AI can sometimes spawn right beside you or you'll respawn right beside a group of them resulting in your quick death.The friendly AI is annoying because they just follow you everywhere. They don't follow orders and they don't go anywhere on their own. Often times, they'll crowd around you and get you killed.The only positives I can give this game is the gun battles that do happen without RPG spam and the enemy AI is fun to play against. I'd make this a positive review if RPGs were made optional or decrease their number among the AI and the ability to issue orders to friendly AI via the voice command menu. The way the game handles spawns is funky in a lot of ways and needs revising. As it is, the current build leaves me feeling unsatisfied.",detailmovie,http://steamcommunity.com/id/detailmovie

The Boomer- Nothing much to explain about him he is a bloated infected who will throw up boomer bile on the survivors attracting a horde to attack them and attractting nearby infected if killed he will explode showering bile on nearby surfaces and survivors their is an item that allows the survivors to use his own bile against him. The Hunter- A hooded teenage looking infected who will leap great distances to catch lone survivors dealling massive damage untill killed or freed can leap from far and high places to deal damage pounces which range around 1 to 25 damage dealling instant damage and is the only infected that does not have to wait for his ability to recharge. The Charger- This infected has a large arm that will smash into survivors knocking other team mates into the air he cannot be bashed off his victim normally having to be killed a Charger may also ram survivors off high places incapping or killing instantly. The Jockey- The Jockey is the only infected that can move their victim around willingly instead of the Chargers ram which cannot be steered as well as the Smokers pull and Hunters pounce The Jockey can be fought against though if the survivor mashs their move buttons making it difficult for the Jockey to move them but they also deal damage much like the others clawing at their victims face untill downed and unable to ride like the Hunter it must pounce to capture someone. The Spitter- Purely a support infected like the Boomer the Spitter can split survivors with her acid spit or can spit on incapped or ""pinned"" survivors spreading panic and killing the survivor quicker making it a valuable asset to the team if used correctly like the Boomer its death has a last act of revenge spreading its acid although smaller on the ground like its spit attack. The Tank- The Tanks the brute force and favorite of most players the Tanks only goal is to spread damage to kill or make a miserable mess of the survivors defences with 3 different attacks like its punch attack which knocks back survivors knocking them senseless for a short amount of time a rock throw attack taking out snipers who aren't willing to take any damage from the behemoth and knocking them down giving the Tank a chance to get close and a car/object punch which sends any car or object flying and immediatly incapping survivors or on rare chances stumbling them or killing them making it very effective at taking out close groups and clusters. The Witch- The Witch is one of the only infected thats avoidable only attacking when disturbed killing and incapping in one hit being startled by flashlights and close survivors.Realism and Realism Versus- Realism is a gamemode of pure teamwork being unable to see someone through walls or being pinned also Witches will kill in one hit Realism Versus is purely the same as Versus defualt just with the added rules of Realism.Survival- Much like the Call of Duty gamemode Zombies but with a twist the survivors are able to equip anything they like before they start the match and instead of rounds its random hordes and Tanks as well as a timer recording how long your team survived 2 alteritive Mutations( We will get to these) are Survival Versus which is Survival with Versus merged and one team sets the time while the other beats it and keeps going till one team does not beat the others time and Hold Out which is like a Hold Out finale but quicker to finish.Scavenge- A quick version of Versus one team must collect gas cans and put them in the generator while the infected team must try and stop them from beating their score the first team to beat their score all added together wins the match.Mutations- Weekly gamemodes like Hunting Party, Last Man On Earth and TAAAANK! that are available on the Steam Workshop along with other community made skins and Campaigns that are remixes of gamemodes or entirely new ones as earlier mentioned Survival Versus is one such gamemode.Now for the conclusion this game has its ups and downs like its prequel but its worth buying the glitchier but funner version on P.C with the custom content and free DLC some players do not like the lack of weapons while most like it cause its simple and means your favorite weapons never too far from reach but what about the gamemodes? are some even worth playing? It is true that Survival and Scavenge are not played as much like Mutations mostly cause most players normally have enough time on their hands to play a full Campaign or Versus match and most of the Mutations that are fun require manual installation or having to be found in the wasteland of the Steam Workshop but this does not mean its not a bad game I rate it 9/10 Cause of its teamwork based gameplay which I have yet to see in many games and plus Valves style of simplicity with simple graphics and not overly complicated gameplayer (I am looking at you Battlefield and Call of Duty) this games a hit and miss some people will like it some will not but I absolutely love it as I have played the first since it came out and loved that even though I was missing alot such as weapons and items and lacking infected varity but its simplistic gameplay style contributes to it so thats my review and have a great day!",whyareyoubotheringwiththis,http://steamcommunity.com/id/whyareyoubotheringwiththis

Space Engineers is a game based around creating ships for mining, combat and salvage using a relatively simple set of parts, such as rotors, cockpits and drills. These can be used to create simple combat ships piloted by the player, large cargo and player transport vessels or even remote mining drones, using the remote control and camera blocks currently implemented in the game. Space Engineers is easy to learn, but difficult to master. New players can quickly build a small ship for simple purposes and eventually move on to designing large-scale automatic mining drones and other such creations. The graphics are not particularly impressive, but certainly get the job done in a satisfactory way. The music and sound design fits the game perfectly, featuring songs of a graceful and occasionally epic timbre, perfectly fitting the graceful, epic setting of space. The inclusion of multi-player in this game is a welcome addition and is a lot of fun with friends who know what they're doing. The game is not perfect though, as can be expected with early access titles. Overall, Space Engineers is an incredibly rewarding and satisfying experience, both with and without friends to play with. If you are interested in physics-based ship construction or more complicated survival-based games, i would highly recommend that you support Keen Software House and pick the game up. Space Engineers in my eyes is amazing, thats why im giving it an 8/10 for its clever design and brilliant gameplay.",Newboy65,http://steamcommunity.com/id/Newboy65

Through its vivid colors and music, the game gives every single different scene its own style and atmosphere. Often I just pause, and stare at the sunset, or the stars and admire the scene. Along with these admirable qualities, FEZ brings new and innovative ideas to the platforming and puzzle genres, which we will hopefully see in future games.

The concept of the game is pretty basic - join forces with three other players and beat up some zombies with a frying pan, or if you're tired of hearing the screams of dying infected - be the infected AND HEAR THE SCREAMS OF THE SURVIVORS INSTEAD. HA HA!Basically, if you get bored of playing as the survivors, the game gives you the option to fight against other players as 8 different special infected ranging from long-tongued Smokers and crying Witches to acidic Spitters and ""my vomit brings all the zombies to the yard"" Boomers, while some have their advantages and disadvantages, they are still very fun to play (sometimes). All I have to say is that L4D2 is one of my favourite games to play - especially with friends - and I want to emphasise the ESPECIALLY. Don't get me wrong, playing with random players is still pretty fun, but can be off-putting if they're too good and immediately overpower other players, including me (which happens quite a lot, but hey, what can I say? I'm no pro at L4D2).Overall, I really enjoy this game and give this zombie-shooter a 5/5!",TheREDPHOENIX,http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheREDPHOENIX

The game tries to make you feel good with this system of constant rewards and progression although it fails because you don't actually feel accomplished.-: No storyline, NONE.-: This game is repetitive, most of your objectives in this game are basically 'kill this and receive this' or... 'mine this and receive this'.  Due to there being no storyline you find yourself asking 'why am I even doing this?!'.-: No actual quests, you have a pre-determined set of quests that every player in the entire game is also doing. You have no freedom to do what you want (that is if you want to actually make progress within the game), you MUST complete the assigned quest to move onto the next one.-: The  entire game  is randomly generated making there feel like there's nothing to actually explore, it's just randomly generated terrain and dungeons (that also seem to be very repetitive). -: You must make an account for the game itself, this isn't so bad on its own however it can be very frustrating trying to get your verification code from your email to work (both me and my friend had the problem).-: Character customization itself is bad, (not the hats, there's plenty of those). there aren't many color options, as far as physical traits just about all you can do is change your skin color (e.g. you cannot change your height, width, etc.).-: Things in the tutorial seem to be out of order, for example around my first hour of gameplay I was being being told the buttons used to attack even though I had already killed loads of enemies.-: Does not have very much music.-: All drops are marked as uncommon/rare+ when it comes to the rarity tag of an item, I've never seen a single item marked as 'common'. I feel the game does this to make you feel more accomplished.This game has/had a lot of potential, it really did. Sadly I have to say that I must give this game a 4/10 for the reasons listed above.",Mastic,http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mastic
40710,1 person found this review funny,1 of 1 people (100%) found this review helpful,230410,,"Posted April 1, 2014.","The game is quite good, however you will be grinding through every mission to collect credits, materials even the blueprints which give a challenge. However this game have a lot of grinding to do like leveling your weapons and frame to rank up and collecting materials by doing the same mission by farming, and other stuff like it. And you have to wait a certain hour to finish a weapon or frame.The pro is that there is a lot of missions and weapons for you to play with and the best part is the frames where each frame have a different ability to suit your way of playing wether you want to be stealthy or run and gun or even melee every enemy in the game. There is missions where you can get exclusive weapons such as event or alert missions where you can get helmet blueprints or extra credits. You can also have a clan in the game and build a dojo where you can do pvp or make powerful weapons that can only be crafted at the dojoNow the con is that you are given a really small slot and some platinum which platinum can only be obtained with REAL money where platinum can be used to instantly finish a building progress or buy weapons without having to get the materials (not the prime weapons though) and you must think well before spending your platinum or you will get a problem later on. And one of my problem is the potato's (you will know after playing it) is where it doubles the points for your weapon BUT without a doubt its hard to get the ""potato"" as sometime they appear in alert mission while you are asleep or at work. And not to mention the enemies gets harder overtime and the fact that there are different type of enemies which force you to use a different weapon on each faction to get the best results.In conclusion the game itself represents a great 3rd person mmo where you play as a space ninja but need a lot of grinding which is perfect for people who likes grinding or rpg games. However if you are impatient and a singleplayer player, i would not recommend this for you because in some mission its nearly impossible/hard to solo as this game requires great teamwork and patience since you wont get anything instantly in this game.",76561198066255046,http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198066255046

This is also one of the only games I have ever bothered to unlock all Achievements for.  If youâ€™re looking to get into stealth games, I recommend you start out with this one. Mark of the Ninja is 2D, and thus, unlike in a 3D Stealth game, this game is able to show you all the information you need on screen at once, making it easier to plot out your next move. This makes the game great for beginners. Plus, the controls are easy to master.This game also supports Ghost/Traditional Stealth and Aggressive Stealth, as well as providing you with a variety of ways to complete your objective, and thus, the game hardly goes stale. Do you want to sneak past all the enemies, using non-lethal tactics, and leaving no trace that you were ever there in the first place? Or do you want to sneak through the level, stalk your enemies, silently assassinate them from the shadows, and become the ultimate predator and master of your environment? Whatever type of stealth your into, this game letâ€™s you do both. Personally, when it comes to Stealth Games, this one in particular, I am a hybrid of both of those playstyles, and that is what I would recommend.The only issue I really had with this game, was the plot. In my opinion, the plot is rather interesting, and itâ€™s nice and tight. But personally, I felt as if they couldâ€™ve done more with the story. However, the ending is exceptional, and very well done. I am not going to mention spoilers, don't worry.Overall, this game is very good and satisfactory. If youâ€™re really into these sorts of games like I am, this is a must own.",Revan_Aldrei,http://steamcommunity.com/id/Revan_Aldrei

This game barely puts a foot wrong.While I had fun trying out all the different plasmids on offer, I heavily used the electric one because it was useful over multiple areas. It disables enemes, can obviously kill them (especially in water, and hey guess where Rapture was built) and didn't destroy corpses so you can still loot them ie. freezing. Overall, what you use regarding plasmids and weapons is a combination of personal preference and the fight scenarios. From what I've heard, a lot of people had their preferences lean towards the shock choice though (Is it just me or is electrocution just the favoured mod of choice not matter what the game?)If you're a giant chicken like I am, Rapture is a haven of creepy hallways, chilling music and lots of jump moments (hint: not all those bodies lying around are actually dead). Do the game justice and use the proper brightness setting for maximum effect, and if you don't have surround sound, be prepared for some tricky moments as you try to figure out where that noise is coming from.One of the twists of the game is the Little Sisters. As you hunt them down for Adam to advance your skills, you can choose to harm them or heal them. Predictably this ends up varying the final ending of the story and while neither choice is technically 'wrong', there's the obviousness of the 'good' choice versus the 'evil' choice. You can choose to go half and half, but if you ultimately want the cuddly feel-good ending then you of course gotta commit to being a saint for the whole game.

As the trailer says, this game is only as violent as you are. So you can get wait in line for your confession at the church and walk away [or run] quietly when stereotypical fanatical islamists invade. Or you can say screw it, chop off everyone head's off with an axe, set the priest on fire, and mow down hordes of angry terrorists. Same with buying milk.      And of course, you can urinate on everything.The game only saves when you enter a new area though, so be prepared when you die and respawn right at the start of a tough slog through a redneck lair cus you forgot to save manually. Objectives can be completed in any order and at your own pace. Feel free to sidetrack and rob the bank.However, the added 2 days, Acopolyspe weekend, is rather an insult to the open world, explore at your own pace style of postal 2. With an extremely linear story, no maps or open world, and angry hordes of soldiers, terrorists, zombies or eco fanatics  to wade through. In a nutshell, you walk along a linear hallway, shooting and slogging your way through hallucinations, poor lighting, bad story, and a kick â™¥â™¥â™¥ ending movie/trailer. Which you can just type open movieoutro in the console on friday when you completed all your tasks. Doing this will unlock enhanced gamemode. :DIn short, even though an old game, worth seriously considering buying . If you want to try out acopolypse weekend, just play through the hospital level. You will see why i advice you to just type open movieoutro for a quick ending.",76561198075597491,http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198075597491

The multiplayer community is quite large, and the many differant game modes available each gives a differant gaming experience... Within G-Mod there is many gaming experiences to be had, alongside friends or just complete randoms, being a jerkwad in the sandbox servers, wreaking havok in the Dark RP servers, you name it, it can happen in gmod if you put your mid to it.I rate this game 8/10, not giving it full potato because of the age of this game and the sheer amount of errors and blank textures you will come accross, but it gains its solid 8 from the graphics, gameplay and sanbox capabilities.",keractagon,http://steamcommunity.com/id/keractagon

Wieder nur neue Maps zum vollen Preis (50-60â‚¬) und Premium-Inhalte, die ihr Geld nicht wert sind. Was damals noch eine SelbstverstÃ¤ndlichkeit war, wird heute zum Preis von 15â‚¬ (fÃ¼r 5-6 Maps) verkauft! Die Story ist ausgelutzt, die Grafik veraltet, der Multiplayer Hacker-verseucht.Wer so etwas unterstÃ¼tzt, darf sich nicht wundern, dass die QualitÃ¤t von neuen Spielen immer mehr leidet. Ich fÃ¼r meinen Teil kann sagen, dass Modern Warfare 3 mein letzter Call of Duty-Teil war, so lange sich nichts Grundlegendes Ã¤ndert.

This stupid â™¥â™¥â™¥ game is lying. You play at first and have fun. Then some â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ with an Anger starts shooting you and teasing the fact that you were a gibus and don't have any cosemetics. You don't understand but start to learn about trading and hats. The Sniper with the Anger then keeps taunting you and you become fed up. You put money in your wallet and trade for a Genuine Anger. You put it on and start killing the experianced Sniper due to the long hours of TF2 you have forged through blood and sweat and finally manage to dominate him. You tease him with your Genuine Anger, expecting him to react. But He doesn't. He just stands there and laughs. For he is Satan himself. He laughs at your for spending money on pixels and vanishes. You hold your Genuine Anger (no pun intended ) and Austrailium Sniper Rifle. Realising you have become the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ Pay 2 play sniper that bullied you. You are angry. You need to take it out on someone. A little sniper with a gibus walks out of the enemy's spawn, you smile.Short version: Basically, some stupid â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ â™¥â™¥â™¥ sniper kills you a lot. So you end up buying hats to â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ him off. But he is satan so it doesn't work and you lose.EDIT: Why is the word P-I-S-S a censored word, like one of the main characters basically chucks a jar of it at people to hurt them. wtf.",76561198149939310,http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198149939310

The universe and atmosphere are so interesting and lively, the story goes from cutesy highschool drama to really dark themes very quickly and finally, and most importantly, this game made me feel something. I genuinely cared for the wellbeing of the two main characters which is more than I can say for any game I've played previously and this only adds the the emotional devastation that comes from some scenes. The only one thing about the game I could say I dislike is the endings clearly limited by time constraint and budget but otherwise, the experience was one that I'll not soon forget. If you're thinking of buying this game, stop thinking. You're only wasting the time you could be spending playing it.9.9/10",Teddy8910,http://steamcommunity.com/id/Teddy8910

For a game that is only in Alpha it is pretty much perfection. When you start off the game is freakin terrible. You will more than likely die more than once to a bear, zombie, wolf or even another player looking to be an â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. But within about an hour of learning slowly, you learn how to suvive, how to harvest wood and stone, how to craft a weopon to kill for food (the starting stone is hard to kill with) and eventually build an effective house with a strong defence. This game is full on multiplayer and playing with freinds is a much better way of playing it, as you can help each other create a small town and guard it. Playing solo is not as nearly as good, simply because people will come in parties who have better gear then you and will kill you and take everything you have just worked so hard for. It is a LOT harder to take down a party with M4's then a lone wolf with a revolver.Only two downsides to this game are, as I have already mentioned, starting sucks a lot (most games do, but this game is unforgiving without a party), and the second is the occasional glitch of an ai (wolves and bears mainly) attacking through walls (mainly cpu buildings). However considering that the game is still in Alpha and a lot of work will be done on this amasing game, I dont really think that it will discourage most people to play this amazingly well made game.Thank you Facepunch studioes, for developing this amazing game.",somefaggotalreadytookjimmy,http://steamcommunity.com/id/somefaggotalreadytookjimmy

Simply hover your mouse over Trove on the taskbar and it should show you a 'preview' of what's meant to be on your screen now, simply right-click on the small slot and click 'maximise'. Then it will show up! I believe that it was just so tiny that I couldn't see it or press maximise. [EDIT]10/10 would get a game that shows you the intro screen.1. Started listening to the most amazing electro / dance mix ever.2 . Spent half an hour getting past Glyph's security measures (Although that was mostly my internet spazzing out).3. Was basically told that my password was awful.4. Finally signed up for Glyph and Trove.5. Installed Trove which was relatively quick.6. Opened the Glyph homepage for Trove.7. Noticed that you couldn't put it in fullscreen which didn't matter as it was the homepage.8. Was excited to finally play Trove.9. Opened Trove and pressed play but nothing happened.

He's got cybernetic limbs and is on a mission for America, but he's letting his gun do the talking, and his gun doesn't speak English.The game itself, while being little more than a texture update for FC3, does very well at evoking the style of an Ahnold or Stallone movie. Everything, from the quotes spouted by enemies, to the intentionally cliche dialogue, makes you feel as if you got into a bad acid trip and woke up on the set of Predator. What I especially love is the weapons; each is, in itself, a reference to a pulp action or sci-fi classic.It's weird, it's wacky, it's totally wonderful, it's Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon, and god damn is it awesome.",trollunderthebridge,http://steamcommunity.com/id/trollunderthebridge

Awesomenauts flawlessly combines a platformer with the MOBA genre.

Beyond that, this is your typical Bioware RPG. Great stories, both overarching and personal (though the main plot is admittedly quite generic, nonetheless it is well executed), great dialogue and great replayability. Definately recommended.",76561198082096463,http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198082096463

Car handling will take a lot of getting used to if you are only used to Dirt, and even if not they still take a lot of concentration and planning ahead to drive them fast and not wreck horribly. The sound is top notch. What I was most surprised by was how good the video performance is. You can tell it has been optimised very well for PC. My system isn't exactly new by any means [Phenom II 940 @ 3.5GHz, Radeon 6970 @ 950MHz, 16GB RAM], yet I can run it comfortably with almost everything on Ultra settings @ 1080p. Framerate is around 60fps most of the time, and drops no lower than 40's from time to time. Very impressed!Overall, it's a pure rally game. All of the time and effort has gone into the rally experience, and it really shows. Would recommend if you are looking for a more hardcore rallying game.I will say to take some time to play around with the controls, however. In particular, when I started playing I felt a real disconnect between my control inputs [gamepad] and the car. What I found to be the cause was the 'Linearity' option under advanced gamepad options. Setting it to 100% fixed it right up, mapping my steering input 1:1 with the actual steering input.",edenist,http://steamcommunity.com/id/edenist

38220,,1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful,65980,"Last edited January 4, 2015.","Posted December 26, 2014.","Don't listen to what everyone else says, I say that this is a successful new entry into the Civilization series.PROS:-Affinity System: This is a great system when you can really define who your faction is. Each affinity has specific bonuses which are very helpful such as units, and buildings.-Unit Upgrades: Much better than in Civ V where you had to spend gold to upgrade units. The units automatically upgrade and the upgrades are all different depending on the affinity you have chosen.-Combat: THANK YOU! WE CAN NOW DO COMBAT WITH MULTIPLE UNITS AT THE ONE TIME! This speeds up combat a lot.-Tech Web: A large improvement over the tech tree from previous games, you can choose what to reasearch and when. The 'leaf' techs add even more depth.-Covert Ops: The concept of spies from Civ V has been greatly expanded, you can now steal science, energy (the equivalent of gold), destroy their orbital units, send a seige worm on the city or take the city over in a coup. The list goes on.-Explorers: A better version of the Civ V scout, can create expeditions and recieve large bonuses, orbital units, science, affinity points, etc but they are much weaker combat wise than the scout.-Victories: The victories are very diverse in this game, there are three tied to each affinity, the contact victory, and domintation (which we all know). All of the victories require you to build a planetary wonder, which occupies a tile of land in your territory. After you have built it you either wait, which is fairly boring, or with two of the victories (Promised Land and Emancipation) you have to either bring humans to the new world via warp gate or send in powerful units into the warp gate.-Orbital Layer: A great addition. Can be used to create miasma, clear it, destory the enemy, give you a combat bonus, or an increase in energy, culture, science and food.-Health: Health is the equivalent of happiness and it is more dynamic, not only does it have the usual penalties for being unhealthy, there are now bonuses for having high healthiness! However having positive healthiness can be quite hard to achieve if you have many cities, and wonders don't give happiness/heathiness.CONS:-Factions: There are only eight factions in this game which causes the game to become less dynamic as you can usually expect the same leaders in every game. (But there's finally Australia, Woo!)-Demographics: The problem with this is that there is none, I can't check who is leading in what areas (population, techs, energy production). But there is the graphs you can check at the end of the game (by going into 'Other' then 'Replays') like you could in Civ V.-Tech Web: This is also a con becuase is can be very confusing to know what to research, it can also be hard to navigate (but thankfully there's a filter features and a search bar). After playing through the game for a bit it has become easier to navigate (at least at the start)-Buildings and Wonders: This is probably an early game problem but the icons for building and wonders are very confusing, I have to mouse over the building to see what it is before I reasearch it. The wonders are also more 'nerfed' and don't seem to provide as good bonuses as in Civ V, I personally can't find them in the tech web.-Combat: Again, this is a pro and a con as the whole combat system depends on the affinty level everyone has as the units upgrade depending on your affinity level, if you have a low affinity level and the person who you are at war against has a high one, you know who will lose.-Achievements: There's just a lack of them, Civ V had 287 achievements, Civ BE only has 64 and they aren't as dynamic as the ones in Civ V, this decreases its replay value.Overall this is a great game. I give it an 8.75/10",76561198049642277,http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198049642277

There aren't any predefined aims or goals. We give you the tools and leave you to play. You spawn objects and weld them together to create your own contraptions - whether that's a car, a rocket, a catapult or something that doesn't have a name yet - that's up to you. You can do it offline, or join the thousands of players who play online each day. If you're not too great at construction - don't worry! You can place a variety of characters in silly positions. But if you want to do more, we have the means.Beyond the SandboxThe Garry's Mod community is a tremendous source of content and has added hundreds of unique modes to the game. In Trouble In Terrorist Town, you can be a detective solving an online murder as criminals attempt to cover up their homicides. Be a ball, a plant, a chair, or anything else in Prop Hunt's elaborate, shape-shifting game of Hide & Seek. Elevator: Source is gaming's first elevator thrill ride, delivering players to airlocks and kitten dance parties. We have one of the most vibrant Steam Community Workshops, with over 300'000 models, maps, and contraptions to download. It has everything from new tools to improve your builds, to guns that fire rainbow-tinged nuclear blasts from space. Take as much or as little as you need: itâ€™s all free.

With Cash.Full Review:- StorylineThe plot is simple. There is a war going on between the Builders League United (BLU) and Reliable Excavation Demolition (RED), both subsidiaries of TF Industries. However, due to problems lacking an obvious bureaucratic solution, mercenaries are contracted to address the situation through war. You join one of the two teams (not permanently) and play as one of the nine mercenaries (hereby named 'classes') which each has its own unique features in a war to Attack/Defend (e.g. Payload, Attack/Defend Control Points) or to gain control (e.g. King of the Hill, 5CP, Special Delivery)- Gameplay/ClassesThe nine classes all play an important role in the game and having too many (or the lack thereof) of one class leads to an imbalanced team, causing the team to suffer heavy penalties in terms of co-operating to push towards their objective. The nine classes, Scout, Soldier, Pyro, Demoman, Heavy, Engineer, Sniper Medic and Spy all have their own distinct features, ranging from invisibility cloaks to the all common 420blazeit sniper. The weapons are more or less well-balanced, in the sense that no weapon is vastly considered to be better than the stock or another weapon, although it does suit different fighting styles.With new maps (almost, or at least somewhat) consistently introduced, you get a different gameplay each time as you encounter players who genuinely help the team, players who go in alone and complains no one is there to help, or players who are so accurate with their shots and low ping you don't stand a chance (unless you lag shot them with your 500 ping). You might also join a ""friendly"" server where you see players just taunting and ""Conga-ing"" or walking around, and killing them earns you a kick or a callout for a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.- WeaponsMost weapons are attained through item drops which occur as you play, so as to ""encourage playing"" until the item drop cap for that week is reached. Strange and Festive variants can be obtained by using keys (purchased with Steam Wallet) to unlock normal, rare and seasonal crates. These are however, purely cosmetic and do not affect gameplay in anyway (besides distracting you). Using the weapons you get, you can craft them into another weapon of your liking or even get a chance to craft a more uncommon reskin weapon, such as the Mauler and Sharp Dresser. Some weapons can also be obtained via achievements and in general, the weapons are considered sidegrades -- except for several Medic melee weapons, all the weapons can be considered to be both better and worse than the stock weapon you are given.- Cosmetics & Online InteractionTeam Fortress is well-known as hat simulator. Using the weapon drops you get, you can craft them into Refined Metals and eventually recombine them to get a common (named as 'Unique' in the wiki, and 'Normal' in-game) quality hat (TF2 Premium DLC is required, obtained upon any in-game store purchase). Rarely, you may also get hats or even taunts via item drops. This purely decorates your character but does ""most"" of the gameplay here. Saw that cool-looking unusual guy? Aim him. Saw that gibus (an achievement hat) guy? Aim him. See that guy with ten thousand kills on his strange weapon? Aim him. That dumbass guy who just started playing? Aim him. (There's some toxicity in every game, so expect that.)The cosmetics also run all of the trading in TF2 and it is what allows you to actually earn (or lose) money (in terms of keys) and/or Steam Wallet (by selling the keys on the market). If you are lucky during an unbox, you can also get an Unusual-quality cosmetic or taunt, basically a normal cosmetic or taunt with an additional effect, and this fetches a very high price in the market due to its highly valued effects (market and player dependent).You can play the game fine if you do not care for cosmetics and you can simply find some traders or trading sites to exchange for the weapon you want. Trading is based on own personal experience which is unique to almost everyone and this cannot exactly be reviewed. Online interactions are not rated.- VerdictIt's a fine game for playing, similar to those less traditional FPS that you play, i.e. not the Counter-Strike types. Other than tryhards who remain tryhards and you can never kill them, or beggars or trolls which you can mute or change a server, this game offers many playstyles which will definitely suit you, at least one way or another.",awakenedspirit,http://steamcommunity.com/id/awakenedspirit

This game has took a step backwards and sure they added ship upgrades and crew members but was it worth loosing all the cool â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ the beta had to offer? Please add a feature where we can play previous builds so I can play the beta again with all this stuff still in the game I don't like this story idea, it ruins the self progression and makes gameplay less fun as you've done everything by the time you finish the story and there's nothing left to do, starbound has turned into an RPG from a sandbox and I want to see it get turned back to what it was",JimmyCheese,http://steamcommunity.com/id/JimmyCheese

Problem polega na tym, iÅ¼ o ile CoD4 MW miaÅ‚ zarÃ³wno fantastycznÄ…, nowatorskÄ… i nawet jakoÅ› w miarÄ™ wiarygodnÄ… kampaniÄ™, bardzo dobrÄ… grafikÄ™ jak i Å›wietny tryb multi, o tyle MW2 byÅ‚o potwornym rozczarowaniem. Fatalna kampania, absolutnie nie wiarygodne pomysÅ‚y. Do CoD MW3 podszedÅ‚em wiÄ™c z duÅ¼Ä… dawkÄ… sceptycyzmu, wyuczonego juÅ¼ na kampanii BF3. KtoÅ›, kiedyÅ› napisaÅ‚, Å¼e ""co druga gra z serii Call of Duty jest udana"" i chyba faktycznie tak jest. PrzejÅ›cie kampanii zajÄ™Å‚o mi ok 6h. Tym niemniej, to co na mnie zrobiÅ‚o jakieÅ› wraÅ¼enie to to, iÅ¼ w MW3 historia jest o wiele ciekawsza niÅ¼ w MW2. Po drugie, jest zdecydowanie dÅ‚uÅ¼sza a juÅ¼ w porÃ³wnaniu z BF3 wydaje siÄ™ niemal ""gigantycznie"" dÅ‚uga. OczywiÅ›cie, moÅ¼na i naleÅ¼y mieÄ‡ zastrzeÅ¼enia co do wiarygodnoÅ›ci opowieÅ›ci z kampanii (Å¼enujÄ…cy wÄ…tek jednego ubermencha, ktÃ³ry rozpÄ™tuje wojnÄ™ miÄ™dzy dwoma mocarstwami - jeszcze w MW2), na pewno totalny brak zrozumienia twÃ³rcÃ³w gry dotyczÄ…cy strategii defensywnej NATO i Rosji, skutkÃ³w uÅ¼ycia broni masowego raÅ¼enia i odpowiedzi drugiej strony, wreszcie zupeÅ‚na ignorancja dotyczÄ…ca prowadzenia wojny nuklearnej oraz strategii Odstraszania.

The game was abandoned roughly a year ago, or more but I can't remember. A huge patch would revive this game but it will probably be too little too late. Australian servers were removed a while back. Oceanic players will probably have better connections playing Blacklight Retribution Asia, or soon to come out Blacklight Retribution Russia.

Blacklight: Retribution (BLR) is a first person shooter set in a dystopian future not too far away with a steampunk feel. There's not much storyline but it's based of its predecessor, Blacklight: Tango Down. The world was ravaged by a virus that turned people into the infected (SIVs) released by political extremists called the â€œOrderâ€ and the only people left to stop them are hired mercenaries (you). BLR is currently being published by Perfect World Entertainment (PWE) while content is being published by Zombie Studios. BLR PS4 is published and produced by Zombie Studios.I started the game a while ago. I got pub stomped all day every day for the first 20 or so levels because BL:R was my second ""legit"" PC FPS game that wasn't full of potatoes. Now as a level 50 life's easy. A lot of new players call BLR pay2win. Well, it's far from it. It is severely play2win in my opinion. Heck, the starter assault rifle is deemed the best weapon in the game due to its versatility BUT to fully customise it to your liking will take time and effort (a long grind). Alternatively, you can rent parts and new guns (receivers). Each time you level up a level pack is awarded to you which includes all the unlockable items for that level for 3 days. The game offers a wide variety of guns with their specific niches but the assault rifle in doubtfully the most used due to its versatility.  Yeah, all the starter stuff is pretty damn good and all you need really (almost).Gameplay wise BLR, itâ€™s pretty solid. The game features a hyper reality visor (HRV) which is basically legitimate wall hacks. For a short period of time every once in a while you can see through walls and pinpoint enemies on the map. For this reason, there is no mini-map but this mechanic ensures that gameplay is always fast paced. Camping can be quite difficult in this game.  The recoil in this game is honestly not that bad and the spread is in a random cone around your cross hair. For that reason â€œprofessionalâ€ players like to use static crosshairs. Concerning the grenade throwing mechanics, they feel wimpy and I donâ€™t like it but itâ€™s probably just me. You will hate corners if you want to turn them hugging the wall because you will get stuck and die a lot. Elevators can glitch out sometimes letting you jump super high, off the map, in the map and such.There are many maps that are small (Helodeck) to medium (Dropzone) to large (Vortex). All in all there are roughly 18 maps and 9 gamemodes. 2 gamemodes are restricted to specific maps and Iâ€™ll talk about those soon. Basically you have the traditional, bread and butter gamemodes of every (most)  FPS;  death match, team death match, king of the hill, capture the flag, Search and destroy, and onslaught (PvE, zombies, the map Centre only). Concerning search search and destroy, the bomb has hrv cloak which basically masks a personâ€™s netwar signature from HRV. Basically they cannot be seen on HRV. The other game modes include domination, netwar and siege. Domination is when you hack nodes (these box thingies) to capture them and gain points. Other teams can take/retake nodes captured by the opponents by hacking them but there is a firewall (time frame) which stops the node from being retaken after capture. netwar is a mix of capture the flag and domination. Siege is where you transport a scorpion tank through a specific path towards the enemyâ€™s base. Players can pilot the tank which has a minigun that can tear through enemies like hot butter through a knife. There are checkpoints in which the team escorting the tank have to hack panels t lower barriers in order for the tank to proceed.In BLR you can pretty much customised everything you want including the HUD using a third party application. You can customise your armour to suit you play style. You can be a tank or a fragile but extremely fast agent. You can customise every part of your gun and there are 23 different types of guns with their own niches. There are over 20 parts for each part of a gun you want to customise (except magazines, thereâ€™s like 5-15 options). There are billions of weapon combinations possible in BLR. You can choose your specific gear such as grenades, tomahawks, explosive resistance patches and such along with your tactical gear such as heal injectors, revive injectors and barricades.Connections wise there are only servers located in the US East and West along with European servers. Australian servers were removed a while back. Blacklight Retribution Asia is an alternative but it has a different publisher. Lag is a major problem for all players.Content wise, this game used to be amazing. It was probably the best free to play game out there and with a bit more love could of gave the AAA titles a run for their money. Sadly, it was abandoned a while ago with the Onslaught patch being the latest patch. There has been speak of content coming soonâ„¢ but then again, itâ€™s always apparently coming soonâ„¢.To conclude this review I would like to say this game has everything to cater for all different play styles. There is plenty of variety to choose from and everything that you could possibly want to customise is customisable. You can earn everything with in game money but speed things up by using real money. A couple of years ago this game was really promising but with the termination of the AU servers, may players said their farewells at the gameâ€™s â€œfuneralâ€. Contradicting the fact that many people left, the gameâ€™s player base has risen by 15% in the past 30 days. This review probably isnâ€™t structured properly and is missing out some important things but I hope it gives you an insight to a wonderful game (well, at least it used to be). I still play this game passionately and you can add me in game :) 8/10 (used to be 92/100 on steam.If I were to revive this game 2 years ago, I would give it 10/10.IGN: VirusAlpha (US) I am an Australian player so my ping is terrible.",76561198097177685,http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198097177685

I know, you might say Assassins creed might be better but thats not really a stealth games anymore as it does not punish you if you do not use stealth. However this game does.Now, if you do not like heavily stealth-focused games, DO NOT buy this game as it heavily relies on stealth.The game is SO fun and I highly recommend you picking this game up.The most fun part is probably the parts when you stealth kill a guy from above or using your blink ability to get around a guy and then finally come up to him and show `em who`s boss.Every moment in this game is always tense. At some heavily-guarded parts of the map, I could feel my hand sweating as I use my 'vision"" ability to spot enemies.This game highly encourages you to expore the map as you find potions and runes to heal yourself and upgrade your badass character.(By the way your character, Corvo, is probably the least ""face-seen"" as he barelys shows his face in the game'So, to wrap it all up, this game is a really really awesome game and if you are thinking about getting this game, stop hesitating and buy gmae, NOW.

At first everything was so simple, the supplies in my house were fine and I can loot abandonded houses when the food was running low, but then things changed. The first time I commited evil was in an old house, I had pavle looting it and found it to be inhabited, the people saw me after I stole some of their things, they tried to make me leave, I saw this as a threat, so I killed an approaching man with a gun, after this a woman cowered in fear and begged for mercy, I killed her, she wanted to kill me right? I then realised what I had done, but I was so desperate for supplies I kept going. My character had breif depression after that.I thought I had it bad then. I was very low on supplies, a new girl asked to join my group of three and promised to pull her wait if we deided to take her in, I accepted her request. Immediently afterwards she bacame sick, I then had no medicine left. Then my character Marko went out scavenging, there were people there. They seemed to be nice but I couldn't find what I needed searching through the rubble. Bruno was desperate for bandages, Pavles depression had been lashed out on him even though he was trying to help. I thought it would be ok if I just saw was in the private property, it would be right? Wrong. I looked through it, there was no bandages, the man whose property it was then tried to kill me. And he did. Marko died.That loss was tolerable. I had Arica scavenging for supplies, I hit the jackpot, but as I tried to leave there was a barred door, I could have easly gone around it however I intended on returning here so I decided to break it open, as I did a raider hearrd. That was Arica's end.That really did it for Pavle, he had no chance left, he just kept breaking down even more, I had to have Bruno do all of the work. They were doing ok, then Bruno died. Suicide.Things were really bad then, every night when Bruno scavenged everthing I had would be stolen. Eventullay though tt didn't matter, I just took important things with me.Things were really looking up, I had nearly everything I needed, Bruno was well fed and had plenty of sleep, I thought I may actually be able to survive for quite a while still.There was just one problem. Depression.Bruno commited suicide.I survived 18 days. 10/10 Would have all my characters commit suicide or die for stupid reasons again.Really though. I got more depressed than they did.It was amazingly captivating and a completely incredible experience.",76561198064636400,http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198064636400

I have never played a game that has made me /feel/ as much as Telltale's The Walking Dead. It is often iterated in many reviews, but each decision REALLY matters. Not only for the consequences for your choices, but for the emotions you'll feel. Whether that be sheer joy, relief, hate, or regret. And regret is really what makes this game so enthralling, you can actually make a decision in a video game you'll regret. You'll often think to yourself, ""(this character) didn't have to go through this or didn't have to die if I just made this decision differently"". I promise you, you'll never put the game down once you begin.UPDATE: The ending made me cry like a baby.",76561198064542039,http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198064542039

Beside the main story, with its side quests, there are several downloadable side contents with main story and side quests who will keep you going for hours, days, weeks and even month.For the last half year, at least, I have been hooked to Pandora and it characters and don't regret a minute spent. I can definitely recommend to play it in single player mode to get used to the world of Pandora, it's characters and enemies.But even more fun it is to play it in the good company of fellows who help you out, rely on you and curse with you when thing just don't want to work.It is not the most realistic graphic - but it would ruin the game if it would be.

Steel Ocean doesn't set itself apart from any other Naval Strategy game apart from adding submarines which is the main factor i downloaded the game in the first place.Graphics are decent and the controls are alright i suppose. But i suggest if you want to play a fun, enjoyable and immersive game. Either wait a year for the game to get some major updates or move onto similar games like WoWS (World of War Ships) if you are looking for something a little more immersive.I currently have about an hour and i can already tell it's Pay2Win, and the tech tree isn't complete on many sides/countries.",speddoman,http://steamcommunity.com/id/speddoman

It has an impressive main story with plenty of interesting and dark plot points. It also boasts a fairly intuitive alchemy system and nice flair of atmosphere. However there are a few things that will put off many gamers. Firstly, the combat system is absolutely dreadful. Many say that the combat is fast paced and enjoyable, but the simple fact is that it is shallow and unintuitive, with the only strategy taking the form of combat stances that either make the fight incredibly easy or impossible. Outside of combat, navigation is a bore with fairly generic environments and middle-of-the-road textures. The character models are constantly rehashed, to the point where the same person will show up in every town. At least five times. The animation quality is so lopsided that its sometimes difficult to tell which decade this game came out. In combat scenarios, Geralt has many high quality animations for his attacks in different stances, however, outside of combat the animation quality is lackluster at best. During cutscenes, characters often walk in slow motion when everything else is moving normally, constant speech animations are reused relentlessly and the animations of other elements of characters are just stupid, such as dwarven beards that have a penchant for jumping for joy whenever Geralt talks.While the main story is very well written and interesting, the sidequests are often no more that fetch quests that require you to run to and fro from areas you have already discovered. This is an example of clear presence of relentless padding and backtracking. As if that problem was not enough, many of The Witcher's quests are time-of-day dependant. This means that to begin and hand in most quests you have to find a campfire and rest until the quest is availible, which will also remove any buffs that you have applied to your character. The game has many problems and easily causes boredom, however a single playthrough is recommended, simply because it sets the stage for the far superior sequel. I give The withcer: Enhanced Edition a 6\10",mgooisu,http://steamcommunity.com/id/mgooisu

Like all games, there are good things and bad things. The bad things in this are occassionally hackers, matchmaking waiting times, slow servers, and bugs that are not game breaking, but annoying, and also the occasional ungrounded hackusation (mostly from people that don't understand the game). The good things far outweigh the bad. The community is very friendly and rarely toxic, maps are detailed and destructable, gunplay is usually tight, the game is tactically inclined, no running and gunning like CoD, rounds are short, gameplay is often completely different each round, etc. etc.It's not a perfect game, but it is very very good. 8.5/10.",impurepaladin,http://steamcommunity.com/id/impurepaladin

And it looks so GOOD in the trailer, lightsabers, mechs, dinosaurs. sounds like a recipe for fun.Unfortunately tons of velociraptors in your face that instantly blur because the textures blow isnt fun.guns that have a muzzle flash after you fire isnt fun.No tutorial what so ever isnt fun.microtransactions arent fun.And gameplay elements that are terrible.I gave up playing as a velociraptor in thirty seconds because you cant strafe so the only thing to do to a human is run right at them. No way to out manouver, and considering the humans can kill you in two seconds..Even as a human the game felt grindy and unpolished. You can unload TONS of ammo into the larger dinosaurs and get no results and not even anything to let you know they are taking damage apart from some out of place looking numbers on the screen and a bad looking blood splatter.Now, I don't usually care if graphics are bad.But I want my bulltes to line up with my fire, I want to not be the wrong colour and have no textures for three seconds after spawning, I want what feels like a complete game for my money.At this tage, I have to recomend you save yourself tha embarassment of trusting this game to deliver.EDIT:Ok they have recently made an update that seems to follow a particular theme, that theme, is that the devs are doing what they can to provide continual suuport, adn are constantly improving the game, basically all the issues I covered here have been fixed. so the game is ok now.",tenryuu_no_hokou,http://steamcommunity.com/id/tenryuu_no_hokou

Nuclear Throne is a Rogue-lite twin stick shooter with an interesting progression system within your runs. Your selected mutant will be able to accumulate different mutations after each stage if you have collected enough radiation drops from enemies. There is a large variety of guns which I doubt I've done more than merely scratch the surface of. The core gameplay loop is very enjoyable and I will continue to put hours into this gem. I do however have a few gripes with the video choices within the game. The framerate is capped at 30. I have heard that this is a problem with gamemaker studio, not necassarily the devs though. Apparently when you create a project you have to explicitly choose a framerate for it to run at and later on requires a tonne of work to change. Perhaps the blame may lie with the devs on that one but frankly it's not a big issue for me becuase of the existing graphical quality of the game and it's not in first person. Also the game is played in a 4:3 window within a 16:9 interface. I think this is an odd design choice but hey- It hasn't affected the gameplay for me. I would also love a story mode for this game, it doesn't have to be 30 hour campign or anything but I think it would enhance the experience for me. I will ot however hold this against the devs.Overall - 9/10I would highly recommend this game to any of my friends and the few video oddities are overseeable.

Ultimately, i feel like the reward system is a bit harsh because you have to buy the same things multiple times if you want to use more than one mech, but other than that its a great game and i highly recommend it",76561198027225504,http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198027225504

You will also acquire ""guns"" which allow you to manipulate some blocks in the maze to aid you.Guns will get better the more you find and allow you to access new areas if you can understand how to use and manipulate it's effects.Simplistic level design and no storyline. Any storyline will be mostly made up by the player.Very little replayability, but there are many different paths and solutions for puzzles leading to those paths that give you a few things to go back and complete.I'd recommend this game if you like mazes and thinking in a way that contradicts logic.This will be a very confusing game for you if you are not prepared.",redsncrimson,http://steamcommunity.com/id/redsncrimson

It picks up right after the ending to Half Life 2, and that's all I'll say without spoiling too much. The story is definately the main thing that keeps you going in this. The gameplay is very repetitive with not much variety. It was pretty much like 'Go into a new area. Clear out area. Repeat.' The game is very short, but I consider that to be a good thing considering that if the game was longer than 5 hours most people would became extremely bored with it quickly with all the repeated gameplay. However, if you loved Half Life 2 you will most likely love this next episode despite all the cons.",mittyt108,http://steamcommunity.com/id/mittyt108

The attitude of the game has moved towards a great strong new direction. Fair warning the game starts off slow, but the more you get playing the better. Especially when you start multiplayer mode. Basic good storyline, easy controls. -I might suggest adding a hand controller option though.The combat is natural, just don't leave your group behind, because you won't be able to handle it all on your own.I also enjoy the small touches like crafting and unique characters and enemies with there own individual skills.Overall I just want more, missions, enemies and maps.Thanks",76561198062993482,http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198062993482

I've playing for about two weeks, and if it's distracted me from modding Skyrim, then it's definitely something great. One of the aspects I appreciate most is the foundry: the freedom to create a DnD-esque questline and, eventually, campaign of your own! Granted, the game itself is awesome and a challenge* if you do it right!In other words: 8/8 m8*note: challenge does not account for everyone, it refers to the way I play.",camduman,http://steamcommunity.com/id/camduman

There are some issues though - Sometimes in levels you spend WAY too long running around.

Second of all I believe that this game is extremely fun when you first start playing because you are in a first person shooter and a class based system which i completely think that is a great  idea because NO one likes playing a world wide multi-player game with only everyone using the same 'class'. Last but not least if your worried about being hacked dont be this game is very secure and believe me everyone I know has never in their life been hacked on this game because it is so secure.-https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_Z_k50ltkY,76561198172099661,http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198172099661

Isaac who is about to be killed by his mom, jumps down to the basement where he will have to fight his way to survive and at the end, he will fight his mom. Binding of isaac is a very rage inducing game. You might of gotten to the last level and die and go to the very begginning. But thats what makes it addiciting.

Taking elements from many other games such as Uncharted and Assassins creed, tomb raider throws you into a world of survival. Lara is not a badass killer or wise guy, sheâ€™s an innocent human who you feel for and actually care about. At many moments you will be shocked at what happens to Lara and you feel her pain. This game has spectacular graphics and a brilliant storyline. But some scenes might turn people off; the game does not hold back on the gore, it does this to keep the player on the edge of his/her seat and to keep with the â€˜survive at all costsâ€™ atmosphere of the game.

Rogue Legacy is a great way of easing players into the difficult retro-sidescroller-ish genre that has been popping up a lot in the indie scene. Sure, you'll die a lot. But you learn more on each death. Unlock other difficult games of recent years (Super Meat Boy, Dark Souls etc) this game forces you to adapt rather than memorise your strategies. Levels will change repeatedly, enemy layouts will change, the way they scale will change - you have to roll with the punches (heh, thanks YNAB).

Thank you for existing. Both friends, rest in peace. It's DOOM!Esto no es un anÃ¡lisis, dedico este gran juego a mi mejor amigo David, quiÃ©n falleciÃ³ aÃ±os atrÃ¡s vÃ­ctima del cÃ¡ncer. Ã©l fue el primero quiÃ©n me enseÃ±Ã³ el mundo de Doom. Y que luego de su marcha quise mostrarle ese maravilloso shooter y muchos mÃ¡s a mis mejores amigos A. y L. Ahora siento que alguien me cambiÃ³ la vida y que quise cambiar, de la misma forma, la vida de las personas que mÃ¡s me importaban. Si estuvieses en vida yo sÃ© que amarÃ¡s ver cuÃ¡nto este gran juego  me recuerda los pÃ­xeles y Windows 95, los dvd piratas y las tardes, despuÃ©s de la universidad, jugando con mi compaÃ±ero de salÃ³n (cuyo cumpleaÃ±os es esta prÃ³xima semana y creo que, ahora, es el hombre mÃ¡s feliz sobre la tierra). Gracias por existir. Descansen en paz ambos amigos. Â¡Es DOOM!",rokrslayr,http://steamcommunity.com/id/rokrslayr

But if you plan on getting this game, make sure you play the first half life, and try to play half life: blue shift and opposing force. After playing those play this game and than the sequels.

All of the micro-transactions are done their and thank god cause non of the micro-transactions are pay to win.there are alot of things in this game that are optional and even better is the modding, this game has been given so many mods that you could say the current version of the game is a mod/modpack.Negatives NetcodeSometimes when i play on the ""peak"" hours of the game i seem to not be able to join games as easly as if i go on when less players are on. im sure this is due to some problem with the ""master server"" or something like.Game breaking glitchsI have found that sometimes my punchs and kicks wont effect the enemy that i am vsing and so they pulverise me. and at other moments i find the game showing the enemy having no legs are arms when they in fact do have legs and arms. im sure that this will be fixed at some point but who knows.JudoI hate judo and i don't have a good reason for why...Is this game worth it?Hell f***ing yeah it is, this game is as addictive as it gets and im sure you will put in huge amounts of time into this game.LinksToribash[www.toribash.com]Toribash forums[forum.toribash.com]Memes[nootnoot.net]",PiePoon,http://steamcommunity.com/id/PiePoon

12360,,No ratings yet,7670,,"Posted August 12, 2013.","Upon completing game, you usually get that empty feeling inside if you complete a very good game. Well, Bioshock is a very good game, and a mustplay ofcourse for everyone who appreciates good story, characters, voiceover, and everything overall. First off, story is something amazing in this game, and the way it was written it's really well done and really makes you get into it more and as you progress, you seek for more answers, why is that, why are you really there and stuff like that. I won't spoil anything ( or I will try not to ) for anyone who may want to complete this game in future, but believe me, if you didn't complete it, shame on you, as much as it was embarassing on me. Game offers EVERYTHING in positive way. I loved characters, I loved voiceovers, and it's damn 10/10 game. For the time being, when the game came out, I think this game should've been game of the year ( if it was, I don't remember exactly ). Anyway, definitly for anyone that hasn't yet play this game, I highly recommend. ""What's different from a man, and a slave?

BUT. this game is fun i recommend it. i read the reviews about it. its all about licenses. what i did. what i tried it out. i thought it was pretty cool. and i spent $50 in EMS alone. and now i cannot stop playing it. it the most realistic hunting simulator on the market. its amazing. and beautiful graphics. the reason nobody plays it is because you need a license to hunt other animals. but all the guns and animals are ethical. you cant kill a moose with a .243 bolt action rifle. this game is fun if you Fully want to try it drop $15 to $20 on it. and to be fully honest this game is however much you want to pay for if you never want to spend a dime you dont have to. if you want to spend $1000 you can. its up to you. i spent $20 for all licenses. 2 guns. and a whole outfit AND alot of other things. and the extra $5 was for a ghillie suit. so it all added up to $20 it was worth it.,SafetyPinLoL,http://steamcommunity.com/id/SafetyPinLoL

This game offers very little new content, with half the assassins ending up being overshadowed side mission that don't do the characters justice.The game itself is still quite good, with most of the core mechanics remaining the same. Movements, expecially grappling and gliding are a little off, and the combat (with the City approach of 'more guys = harder) starts to show it's flaws when surrounded by 20+ enemies.Overall, this game still has a very solid core to it, and should definitely be played. Yes, it is the weakest in the series, but that is because the first two were so strong. Some of the elements of this game are nicely done, just pretend multiplayer doesn't exist though. Writing (although I personally did not like the story) is quite nicely done, and everything about this game still holds it's own.The weakest part of this game is that it is the third in a series, and it is definitely a step backwards. If this was a first up game, we would still highlight the flaws but could see the room for improvment. The sad fact is that there have been two games already that have overall been better. But I do encourage you to play this game, because it is still the same engine and gameplay as the first two - and that is still a damn good thing.",AMV72,http://steamcommunity.com/id/AMV72

This game is here to impress, with a great combat system and choices that actually mean something, e.g. do you join the Stormcloaks or the Imperials?, this is a tough choice as either can change the game quite a bit. Another great thing is that you can do things at your leasure, so if you get bored doing the main sort of story, you can start a sidequest or two like the Thieves guild or the Dark Brotherhood quests, which are a very fulfilling part of the game. No matter what there is always something to do, with dungeons refreshing every few days, and if you start playing with all of the DLC, well you have a heck of an adventure waiting for you.

Alright, I read to unrecommended reviews and, they all talk about bugs, performance issues, being impossible to win, stuff like that. I have not seen any of these. I'm surprised at how bug free this has been for me, the performance is great but that may just be my really expensive gaming PC, and as far as winning, the people saying it's impossible are just really bad at it. I almost win every race. Which, is probably the biggest thing I don't like when it comes to racing games. I play FlatOut, there is no challenge at all and I'm pretty much garunteed to overlap the AI every race. This? Well, it is more of a challenge. I pretty much never overlap anyone. Which is good. The AI are actually decent at driving, unlike a lot of other stuff. And the weapons make it even more fun and challenging! Overall, this game is good.

43783,,No ratings yet,261760,"Last edited May 1, 2015.","Posted April 5, 2015.","I like the concept but I can't really recommend this game - or at least not at full price. It's not a bad game but I didn't find it particularly good either.The story is pretty basic, as least as far as I got. You, Generic Townsperson, were hanging out doing one day doing townsfolky things when your relative was tragically killled by Lord Evilguy and his evil followers, the Cult of Evil. You then gain magic powers and set out to kill Lord Evilguy and avenge your beloved <InsertRelativeNameHere>. There are a few other cutscenes along the way but they don't seem to tell us much we don't already know.Level design is also fairly straightforward - the entire game seems to be one long corridor with the occasional short sidepath, although it looks decent enough.The combat is clearly the meat of the game, but for me it just wasn't that interesting. A lot of people who like the game will claim that if someone doesn't like the combat, it's because they're ""doing it wrong"" - they don't know how to combine spells properly and just throw the one fireball spell over and over. In my case I don't think that's true. I've seen the videos, I've read a couple of guides, I'm using the mastery and control spells, I'm using my blink and block, and I still dodn't find it terribly exciting.Generally, spells work best if you charge them up a bit, and it usually takes several spells to kill an enemy - at the very least, applying ""mastery"" (which increases the power of subsequent hits) and/or a control spell before going for damage is normal. Combine with the fact that the game doesn't really require precision aim - the standard bolt spell actually homes in on enemies! - and combat felt a little sluggish to me.Compounding this is that there is a lot of combat, but all the enemies and environments seem to be basically the same. Once you've got your combos down, the only thing that brings any variety to combat is that enemies spawn with random ""affixes"", similar to the unique monsters in games like Diablo or Path of Exile. This make choosing which enemies to prioritise important - which I assume is what they were aiming for, since there's not a huge emphasis on manual dexterity - but I didn't find it enough to prevent combat become repetitive fairly quickly. Some of the spell effects are pretty flashy if you like that sort thing, however.The other major part of the game is the crafting system, which is potentially interesting but more of a chore than it needs to be. Prepare to spend a lot of time on inventory management, because you're going to amass large piles of junk which you'll need to sort though using an interface which could be better. Again, it's not the worst but it could have been better. If you're really into min-maxing and comparing stats you'll probably love it, though.Overall I think this game is competent but underwhelming. It doesn't really have glaring faults, but I just couldn't get into it. If you love flashy special effects or complicated crafting systems and don't mind a bit of repetition you might get more out of it than I did.",76561198044298623,http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198044298623

Think of it as Mass Effect as combined with Game of Thrones.Story is fantastic, and is great at hooking you in using its backstory system, gameplay is a D&D/FFVII combination, giving it an rpg dice roll feel, and it overall is a very polished game.However, setting up DLC is not an easy task, and will have you fiddling around for a while trying to register everything. My recommendation? Get a bioware account and register the game and its DLC before you load it. Otherwise you will spend four or five hours trying to get it all set up and recognized.

Overall this is a very good game.",rilmer,http://steamcommunity.com/id/rilmer

41000,,No ratings yet,292030,,"Posted September 14, 2015.","If you didnâ€™t already know, The Witcher trilogy is pretty â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing amazing and possible one of the best RPG series of all time. The Witcher 3 Wild Hunt, Pants down is 10/10 any day of the week. Role playing as the ever gloomy but always badass Witcher Garalt, the wide open worlds for you to explore just provides hours of gameplay, not only for exploring but completing quests and finding gear to build Garaltâ€™s armour and craft new weapons. The Witcher 3 is so immersive and just dripping with atmosphere accompanied by incredible voice acting and an amazing soundtrack to boot. The combat is brutal and rewarding for lovers of hack and slash games and really captures the heart of combat, especially when you are face to face with a hideous vampire or terrifying griffin. Fighting groups of gang members, heavily armed guardsmen or an army of nekkers, it just feel â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing great to combine the skills of alchemy and magic as well as sword play to annihilate whatever foe poses threat to you. The plot line is incredibly well written and the voice actors capture their roles perfectly, leaving you in aw every time you engage conversation. Side quests are just as interesting as the main story line, with each area having its own interesting law and characters who create a living, breathing environment that keep you swinging your sword and flapping your lips for hours and hours. Combining combat skills with magic and alchemy allow you as a player to experiments and discover new ways to combat your enemies and with preparation of potions and oils, can turn the tides of any battle. The Witcher 3 Wild Hunt is a visual sceptical that is both gorgeous and it is colourful and vibrant. The Graphical standards are outstanding and leave you with a boner every time you start up the game. CD Project Red seriously put the time and effort into this game and it shows with all the little intricate details and even just simple things that other RPGs just donâ€™t do, and itâ€™s a real treat for players. You will more than get your moneyâ€™s worth with this game, it goes beyond common RPG titles and puts come of this yearâ€™s releases to shame really. When you think of the price of this game and the amount of hours of gameplay, fun and involvement you will get out of it, â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ all over whatever $80 of $90 FPS you think is cool but actually only has 6 to 10 hours of campaign and a few hours of multiplayer till next reskin in a yearsâ€™ time. Itâ€™s a no brainer, if you have to think about it then you are clearly 12 and want to shoot noobs and make the rest of our online lives a living hellâ€¦ if so why are you even hear? I know why youâ€™re hereâ€¦ because you heard that The Witcher 3 Was epic and you wanted to know a fellow Gamers opinion. Well here it isâ€¦ The Witcher 3 is an amazing game, a clear step above most if not all RPGs now days. Itâ€™s a gorgeous and immersive story that will entertain you for hours and hours with its amazing sword play, great voice acting, well written story andâ€¦ boobsâ€¦ yeah there are boobs. 10/10 Keep it up CD Project Red, let this be a benchmark for Cyberpunk! Peace all  <3",76561198054753156,http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198054753156

[That is sarcasm for those of you too stupid to figure it out for yourself]The pacing is perfect, it's not a true survival game unless it takes a year to do anything.The Dinosaurs look great, everyone knows dinosaurs are part rock monster. It's very uniche and not just a survival game with dinosaurs thrown in to cash in on jurassic world.I also love how when you review other dinosaur games negetivly people say ""Try Ark"" it's very useful cause I had never tried it before someone told me to, not at all.

The only problem I have with it is calling it a game. Garry's Mod is a mod of Valve's Half-Life 2. Garry Newman, the man behind the mod, decided to make a map, put some tools in, copy and paste content from the Half-Life 2 folder and call it a game. I remember when this game was 20.00$ back when it looked interesting enough to check out, but with only being a kid with no money, and having a father who doesn't trust buying things on the internet, I was out of luck, so about 2 years later when I had my own card to buy the game with, it felt like the first time kissing a girl, amazing. After everything was all set, actually playing the game, and figureing out how to play was a pain in the as*s. Then, with a website full of content that other people made, and not knowing how to install said downloaded content, was all the more frustrating. Then the big 13 update came along with the workshop so the communnity could hold the mod's hand the whole time, just one problem, the whole game changed so nothing that I learned sinked, all the new features made no sense to a normal player such as my self. To sum it all up, if you want to play this game and have any actual fun, you have to Have no life and learn how to use every feature in the game. If you want to play Multiplayer you have the pleasure of being â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ by doushbag admins, along with having to tollerate ear shattering sounds of little kids crying in the process, while your bing anally destroyed, as the old saying goes, the only winning move is not to play. The only reason to get this mod is to mess around with the Team Fortress 2 stuff, that's why I have it. If you don't have it, and your deciding to buy it or not, if someone tells you that it's something worth trying out, the person your talking to is not your friend, it's probably someone who has Garry's di*ck 1.54 inches in their as*s, probably Milfof6D9. Take it from someone with a life, job, and on the search for games worth playing on Steam, this mod is not worth the time.",76561198062544523,http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198062544523

Once you finally get past the log in screen you have to deal with the terrible automated resoultion which by the way when you first launch the game you can't change because of the f**king useless tutorial, so if you have an adverage monitor like me you can't see the full screen until you manage to click away the tutorials, get into the menu and change the resoultion. Whats even more annoying is that you can't change the aspect ratio. Personally I play games at 4:3 because it reduces lag and feels like it reduces input lag. Whats even more terrible is that once you get into the game, even with maxed out sensitivity its still horribly low so its incredibly hard to aim. I wasn't able to get into a proper match as apparently there were net works issues.

Castle Crashers is a 1-4 player co-op side scrolling Beat-em-Up with a unique sense of humor and a great vectorised art-style.

You essentially are given varying objectives to accomplish and  a modest set of weapon and loadout options to choose from - which is handy, because if you are bad at FPS games you will be using the majority of your time in spectator, playing around with it. Bullets from high-powered rifles tend to one-hit-kill you if they manage to bypass whatever kevlar you have equipped and you will feel very, very vulnerable when moving between buildings.Playing this game is the first time in a while I've actually been grinning playing an FPS for many, many years. The lethality of the firearms makes moving from point to point tense, your decisions matter and your reaction times are crucial.Notably, it doesn't suffer the superfluous unlocking and premium mechanics of the Battlefields of the day, your killstreaks don't earn you an attack-dog airstrike, which brings me to my next point:Everyone, EVERYONE is on an even keel, and it's all down to how well you play. Or how badly you play, as when you die you will be spectating your comrades playing and teasing the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ out of them in group chat, or using the spare time to tweak your loadout to better match the pace of the combat.I'm happy to say that this is well worth the small price - buy the four-pack, give them to your buddies and pretend it's 2002 at a Counterstrike LAN.EDIT: Almost forgot. It has COOP play too!8/10+ Solid, no frills FPS action+ Brutal combat, tense and frantic gameplay+ COOP reminds me of Vietcong 2, good fun- Source graphics nothing to write home about (but who cares)- Do not get this if dying frustrates you",hammyhamm,http://steamcommunity.com/id/hammyhamm

The gameplay is quite basic, with puzzles being quite simple and can get quite repetative at times but are still enjoyable. My only criticism is that the 'skill' based action sequences can get quite annoying and you find yourself dieing a lot. You will find yourself passing them wth simply trial and error.

With its thrilling competitive gameplay its really a much better experience. Csgo provides and enjoyable ranking system that pushes the user to play there best and engage in team based strategy (at the higher levels as low ranks suck and are salty). Unlike cod and other fps's you can derank if too many games are lost. However on the other hand there are negatives like hackers which can be a real pain and overall ruin the experience and the saltiness of the low silver ranks. This is not really a bad thing but there are weapon skins that can be very expensive and if you don't restrain yourself you will have yourself throwing out the dosh in order to gain some of these sexy skins. Overall csgo gives and amazing strategy based experience, it has its negatives but are highly out-weighed by the positives, i recommend this game to anyone seeking a more skill based experience with less of the rpg style of cod, cause lets face it cod is all about leveling up you character and getting new weapons, a lot like other rpg's.I hope this was helpful.",markimoo2,http://steamcommunity.com/id/markimoo2

You would be so engrossed in grinding items with the one fear of losing it all because your computer would lag when you spammed your ""Escape to Nexus"" key.However once Kabam took over, the game has lost its touch. Although there are many new aspects that have been added to the game, such as new dungeons, weapons, pets, I feel that the cons outweigh the pros.Too much stuff has become purchasable, enemy and item spawn rates have been dramatically decreased. Worst of all the highest tier weapons have become untradable. The only way to get them is to grind them (which now takes 100 times as long) or use your money to get them directly, or speed up the process. This of course is stupid as you will probably lose all the items anyway, resulting in a waste of money.All in all this once amazing, rage-inducing, time-wasting game that 99.99% of people who played it enjoyed has gone from F2P to P2W. I'm sure 99.99% of people who play it now would agree with me that this game has become worse since Kabam took over.",ShadicTripleSeven,http://steamcommunity.com/id/ShadicTripleSeven

This is definately worth 60 bucks and if you become as invested as i have it's completely optional to buy DLC to supplement the experience. With each DLC there is a free addition to the game along with the new races appearing in the campaign whether you've bought the DLC or not. DLC only defines yor ability to play new races and the odd unit type. either way the game is an easy 8.5/10 and if you're perked up at all by any of the footage/material then you won't be disappointed.",76561198007041072,http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198007041072

You survive waves of zombies dinos, earn money for killing them and buy progressively bigger and nastier guns with them. Sounds pretty straightforward, and it is. The problems with this game are that it's unbalanced, looks worse than Unreal Tournament 2004 (but still runs horribly) and feels very amateurish for a comercially sold game.For starters, there's only one class out of the 3 you are offered that is actually worth anything, and that is the Assault class (the guy with the jetpack). The other ones have a cloaking mode and a healing gun, but they aren't worth giving up the ability to NOT DIE when you are picked up by a pterodactyl, stop yourself from being mobbed or casually fly around the triceratops that you are pumping full of lead.There are a bunch of purchaseable guns on offer when you finish a wave, but most of them are either too weak or have horrible accuracy/recoil, so expect to use the same guns on every match. Or you could drive around in a warthog-ish buggy and have some guy man the turret (or man it yourself) to become almost invincible to the dinosaurs.There are some things that Dino Horde does right, though. It mixes it up by having you defend generators, fight boss dinosaurs, and move around to different bases, which breaks up the monotony quite a bit, and it is rather satisfying once you get a hold of one of those badass turrets, admittedly.I feel a bit bad for bashing an indie game, and honestly, if you're the forgiving sort, you may get a good amount of fun out of this game, but there are better games you can play about surviving waves of enemies. There are better games about blowing dinosaurs up. There are none to my knowledge about surviving waves of dinosaurs, though, so if you have a fixation for surviving a horde of prehistoric reptiles (perhaps it's the only way you can get it up, i'm not judging you :-D) then pick it up in a sale or something.",solodsnek,http://steamcommunity.com/id/solodsnek

I probably wouldn't pick it up if it was not on sale but having bought the complete pack for $12.74 it was 100% worth it. I feel that it's a real throw back to classic EA titles that really had some plentiful and great content and Spore really has that. The transition from moving my little microscopic creature around eating photosynthetic algae to becoming the dominant space faring race within in the entire galaxy is truely an experience which I have never seen or felt before in a game. The shear amount of customization available in this game is fantastic and is something that I wish was more abundant in more recent games.,somanyinstructions,http://steamcommunity.com/id/somanyinstructions

Just like in Mount Your Friends, if it wasn't by the hanging dongs and the nude characters, the game would be totally focused on the competitiviness it has, while in SpeedRunners, the game has a gayish character with a pink unicorn costume, and another character with a big red ball head with a star on it, symbolizing the comunism.The game has a nice plot, by first sight, since it involves all of an hero world where you need to save scientists from bombs.93/100",TetisTiger,http://steamcommunity.com/id/TetisTiger

It puts a twist on games set in Communist countries; usually drab, copy-and-paste first person shooters. But this game is a true work of art. It has very unique gameplay; you are a checkpoint inspector between the border of two fictional countries called Arstotzka and Kolechia (think East & West Germany) and you must inspect the papers of immigrants to see whether they are valid or not. It gets really hard towards the end. I think only a certain audience would like this game.My only criticism is that this game is really short. I finished the game in around 5 hours, which isn't to say it brings the game down, but more game would be appreciated.I would definitely reccomend Papers, Please, in fact, it's my Independent Game of the Year for 2013 and one of my favourite games of all time. And it's made by one person.100%ing this game is not advised. The game has 20 endings, from going into debt because you denied every single immigrant, or fleeing Arstotzka to go into asylum. If I were a player, I would get Endings 18, 19 and 20, and that's it. There's also a quite fun endless mode.Final Rating: 8.7/10",kitchenappliancewow,http://steamcommunity.com/id/kitchenappliancewow

The first time I played I kept dying to the Asylum Demon, completely unaware of the open doorway to the side...The game doesn't spoon feed you, sure you get some helpful controls scattered along the floor, but after that you're on your own. Death is frustrating, especially when you know you were too greedy with attacks. But nothing feels better than defeating a boss you've been struggling on. The overwhelming taste of sweet sweet victory, your hands shake from the the pure euphoria and rush. I've had a taste, and now I'm addicted.To anyone who thinks this game might be too intimidating: If I could get past Capras Demon, someone who's barely played an RPG, I'm pretty sure anyone can.BLIGHTTOWN!!

12058,1 person found this review funny,4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful,221100,,"Posted September 23, 2014.","DayZ at the time as it is now isn't the greatest it could be as it is still in Early Access and the developers have clearly stated ""WARNING: THIS GAME IS EARLY ACCESS ALPHA. PLEASE DO NOT PURCHASE IT UNLESS YOU WANT TO ACTIVELY SUPPORT DEVELOPMENT OF THE GAME AND ARE PREPARED TO HANDLE WITH SERIOUS ISSUES AND POSSIBLE INTERRUPTIONS OF GAME FUNCTIONING."" nearby the trailer of this game. So if you are looking to buy a full completed DayZ stick with the mod for now as Arma 2 on sale is usually $3 along Operation Arrowhead being $2, this game does have many glitches and you will die alot by glitches such as the following but not limited too- Invisi Ladders- Invisi walls- Invisi zombies- Superzombie wall punching- Walking off roofs when eating- Bandages not working- Lag in generalBut all this is expected in a Early Access gameNow that all the bads are out of the way I can start with the goods. The game has a beautiful artstyle that very much fits the zombie apocalypse setting. also i believe night time is done brilliantly but the flashlight may be a bit too bright you could say (Any DayZ player who has used the or seen the flashlight will know what i mean). Seriously, don't use the flashlight at night, it's a beacon... Anyways, I have to say the interface and inventory screen runs much smoother and is easier to get accustomed too then the Mod version. with nothing clogging up your normal vision and a much easier way to loot and store items into your backpack. Speaking of inventory, DayZ has added the new ability to clothe your character, making it easier to identify people, giving new loot to look for and an all around general gameplay experience, those TTSkO pants could mean the life and death of your character. Also this clothing allows for a new way to store items, some dress items may hold 2-8 spaces and others may hold nothing at all, so it gives (again back to the looting experience) a new way for players to easily pickup and take items without all the hassling around and gives them more stuff to look out for.Now for gameplay, I reckon gameplay can be classified as either 1. Gameplay or 2. Gunplay. So I will cover bothGameplayThe gameplay in DayZ at the time does feel exciting when you first start off and throughout most of your journey to NWAF and back to Elektro or something. but once you sorta get into the higher gear items there becomes less to do, although this has kinda been fixed in the past few updates (Hunting, Fishing and soon to be camptents/camping) you still end up heading down to the coast and preying on Fresh Spawns. But other then that the gameplay of DayZ works real well because you could be roleplaying or just messin around in general.GunplayDayZ weaponry works much like Arma 2 with the exception of melee (I will cover melee near the end) with the change of having to find all your ammo and making sure that ammo is in a pristine - worn condition (Weapon jams may be added in the future). Also, when your new to DayZ you grab whatever firearm is put infront of you, right? but because DayZ implements realism into the firearms you really gotta think if you want to take that Sporter.22 or head to the police station to see for an SKS or such, along with this you have to be aware of what ammo each gun takes and where you can find that ammo, for example if you had the choice between an AKM or an AK101, I will probably go for the AKM as its ammo is relativly easy to find (Counting you found the AKM at a military base) over an AK101, sure the AK101 has a higher fire rate and better accuracy, but the AKM has an easier supply of ammo to be found. Now for the proper gunfights, a gunfight is probably the moment in DayZ where your heart gets pumping knowing that if you die, you lose all that good loot, All dem beans, so this goes back to our weapon problem, because having a good weapon or a bad weapon in a gunfight can result in a different outcome, say if you had a Sporter.22 and you fought a guy with an Mosin, he would probably win, whereas if you had an AKM and you fought a guy with an FNX45 you would probably win. Another important thing you have to know what you're fighting, if its a Mosin you know he can get a max of 2 hits on you before your dead, whereas if its an M4A1 he could probs get around 5-10 hits to kill you. But it really all comes down to who fired first and what position that person was in, if your enemy was in a bush on a hill and you aren't a full experienced player you will probably die, but if you have the situation reversed, then he will probably die. Now melee weapons are a bit different, you will mostly use a melee weapon for zombies only as 1 punch to the head on a person can knock em out, allowing you to steal loot, although don't go punching guys with helmets, 'cause then you will just get a sore hand and probably a few bullet holes. So i prefer to use Melee weapons for zombie encounters only but that is entirely up to you. most melee weapons are 1-2 hits on zombies so that is probably explains why i use them seeing as it will take a few more hits on a player.Anyways all in all i would've given this game an 7/10 because of all the bugs but seeing as it is clearly stated by the developers that you don't want to buy this game if you don't like bugs, I will exlude the bugs and give it a 9/10",76561198024527983,http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198024527983

They said told me that thy were gonna allow this violation as long as i were to â™¥â™¥â™¥ inside. that sums my skyrim life story up 10/10 game of the century!!!!",xShaxix,http://steamcommunity.com/id/xShaxix

You are thrown in the wastle land after leaving vault 101 and from there you have so many choices and decisions that must be and can be made by you which will shape your adventure in the wasteland,  personally, I searched for as many bobble heads and unique weapons that i could find and completed the dlc's which each were very different and added alot to the overall fallout expierience. Most people who play this game know the atmosphere and music that accompanies you on your journey throughout the wasteland is what makes it so great. Galaxy new radio music is what is great and suits the era fallout 3 is based in and the wasteland also. Although the main campaign is fairly short, its all the other things in fallout 3 which make it great, the vats system, the item pick up and repair system, the dark gloomy fallout environment, the overall atmosphere and freedom given to you from near the start of the game and also the perk and specials were very well implemented and encourage multiple playthroughs and experimenting. Problems with it is the short and not so difficult main story, but this is still enjoyable and combined with all other elements creates a game that will be remembered in the history of Games.

My favorite game-mode is Zombie where you can choose to be a Survivor or Zombie (note: there is only one Zombie to start with) then the Survivor's can build constructions using block and can scavenge more blocks by using their pickaxe or shovel to break blocks and collect them. The whole aim is to either kill as many people as possible if you are a zombie or survive the longest and kill some Zombie's along the way.

It takes all great ideas such as fixed camera angles, no checkpoints (hardcore) and a easy to learn but hard to master combat system. The combat system may seem simple at first because there is only an attack button, but with hours of training and mastering you will be able to perform the sikkest combos such as jump attack. Every level is well designed and adds a great sense of immersion to it, they feel genuine and there are many hidden secrets such as apples being hidden in a house with no doors.Finally this game conveys a deep message that is a problem at the core of society, it teaches us that robbing other peoples water and leaving to them is justified as you must save your father. These ethics and values teach us that love for our own family comes at a great price and is a necessary sacrifice, although you could share the water with all the other citizens, why do that when you can beat them up with your magical leaf and hog all the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ for yourself?Under the many layers of content, like an onion, you will need to peel every piece of skin off and discover a whole new world, a whole new meaning of life.

I love it a lot but that doesnt mean it doesnt have its flaws.This DLC, unlike lots of others out there, is not overpriced. It is pretty resonably priced. It is fun, people play it and it really simulates 19TH century warfare very well. But I do think it could do with a decent single player mode, rather than just custom battles, which I do not enjoy. I dont know maybe someones modded in one, but in the vanilla it doesnt.The DLC also has a large community. Many people play it. I just hate MMO titles that are amazing but have no publicity so no one plays them. Napoleonic Wars has many enjoyable gamemodes. My favourite is Team Deathmactch. There is also siege, where one team defends and trys to hold out for a set time and the other tries to capture it. Although, I have experienced a few crashes playing this gamemode, so I dont know whats up with that.I LOVE this DLC. It is well priced, has a good community and great gamemodes. I enjoy it and think everyone should buy it and its base game.NOTE: To those who say ""I dont like it cos it has no single player and I didnt know"" READ THE â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING TAGS BEFORE YOU BUY!

The graphics are abysmal; actually worse, by far, than graphics in games 10 years ago. To put that in context, this year we will celebrate Half Life 2's 10th anniversary. Maybe I just have slow internet (thanks Abbott) but seeing other players move around without even an attempt at leg animation is disconcerting.Following on, the servers are slow as all hell. If you do manage in a semi timely fashion to find and log onto a server, assuming the slow response time hasn't basically frozen your mouse, you will be greeted with some of the worst lag you've ever seen. Be forewarned fair traveller, you will think it's a one-off lag problem. Verily it is not. I have never actually tolerated this much lag in a game and it seems to be a pretty standard part of Nether so there's that. This of course makes combat a frantic button mash with little to no skill.At first I thought this might be why I can't seem to move smoothly, but then I realised that the entire world has been put together so half-assedly that physically conected land elements (like a floor and a ramp) might require you to jump over some imaginary partition holding them together. Clipping is, as you can imagine, basically just part of the ambience at this point.Then there's the game itself. It seems to have no idea how games are meant to work. There are safezones where you spawn when you die. In theory, in a safezone you can't use weapons, can't die, and the nether can't get in. This will periodically cease to be true and you have to run around repairing the anti nether devices. As a noob, you will be the ONLY one running around repairing anti-nether devices. Everyone else can survive without them just fine. When you aren't running for your life from aliens, which teleport by the way, utterly ruining the point of a zombie survival game, you're couriering parcels from A to B in the vain hope that you can scrounge enough bits and pieces from these transactions to craft a semi decent weapon. None of this is immediatley obvious to you as the game has basically no explanation of anything at all.Upon undertaking a task outside the safezone, you will rapidly become aware of the fact that the difficulty of the nether around you will in no way be tempered to suit your skill level or armoury leading me on my first run to take on a small nether army which included a golem (try to guess what they're like) with nothing by a can gun (one shot shotgun made from a spray can) and a sword. Needless to say I died.On subsequent attempts I found fewer nether, which was great for me, but alas this came at the price of having other players around me. It turns out that the average nether player is cut from the same cloth as a day Z player, and will galdy follow a n00b out of the safe zone for the explicit purpose of killing them and looting the $10 dollars they have. Fortunately for them, since they tend to already have automatic weapons and heavy body armour, this is an enetertaining and low-risk sport. For those of us trying to figure out the game, it is not.In short, I have yet to find any element in this game which I think is good. You find eclectic items throughout the world, all of which are terribly rendered and usually look like an entire stash of discrete items, much to your chagrin. You sort of have to guess which ones can be combined at the weapon smith and into what. Until then, you're lugging around 50kg of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ with no way to use it. Things pop up on the screen which I'm sure are meant to be informative, but mean absolutely nothing if you haven't had it explained before, and when you start out, your chance of survival is approximately 0. Since you spawn with nothing but what you could put into a global stash (I assume, this bit is a bit fuzzy) after dying, it makes it nigh on impossible to ever advance to any reasonable level. Statistically any level of enemy can appear anywhere (except the reapers) and players have trained themselevs to see all non-tribe-members are walking goody-bags/piÃ±atas. The game has a decent idea behind it, and if it were designed by competent designers and hosted on semi-decent servers, with a reasonable how-to guide, and some mechanism giving new players are fair shot, it'd be worth the $15. At this point though, I wouldn't even waste the bandwidth on it if it were free.",76561198094722660,http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198094722660

Even if you get this game for free, it isn't worth playing it due to insane life monsters spawning from nowhere, deaths without any apparent reason and things like those. I also need to mention that the screen sometimes freeze and blackout even with no apparent consumption of computer resources. I understand that the Gamemaker platform is a little bit hard to work with but this game shouldn't be considered finished due to these problems, so I already tried a refund request(even with 4 hours of ""gameplay"", or pure stress if you prefer), and even if it doesn't work, I hope someone reads this and pay attention to know that buying this game is a peril to your mental sanity.

The things that make Star Conflict different from War Thunder is the different classes and abilities and factions. I will give a brief run down on the classes and factions. The classes fall into 3 major catagories and alot of sub-classes. The 3 main classes that you will encounter is the Interceptor class; which is designed for speed and maneuvelbility, the Fighter class; which is a class that is a good alrounder, and the Frigates; which is designed for Powerful cannons and strong armour. There are also 3 factions that holds all 3 main classes of ships. The 3 factions are: Empire, Federation and Jericho and if you want to go to the back stories, follow this link --> https://star-conflict.com/en/game/storyline <--. There are 15 ranks not including ships that need to be Manufactured. Each rank has differnet ships per rank and the Crew and Workshop options only occur for when you get a rank 4 and rank 6 ship for any factions. There are 2 gamemodes in Star Conflict that are PvP and PvE. PvP is a head to head combat style gamemode for where the pplayer will be given certain tasks, depending on the mission, to either capture beacons, kill the enemy etc. Then there is PvE, which is where the player fights bots throughout missions to receive points. Then there is Syntax Points wihch is what the player needs to upgrade their ships to go to the next rank. And that is a brief run-down on Star Conflict",76561198082699893,http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198082699893
